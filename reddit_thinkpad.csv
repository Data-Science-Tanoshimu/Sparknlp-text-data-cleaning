T470s i7 7600u RAM upgrade,Hey Folks– I just liked up my first thinkpad and the 8gb of ram was def a bottleneck. I saw some I picked up some Vengeance RAM and plan on installing it tomorrow.

My X230 jumped back in time,This is an odd one:  An X230  using Linux Mint Cinnamon. I used it for work for a couple of hours  then started Steam. Steam crashed when I shut down Rimworld so I restarted the system. It boots up and I was surprised to see items were in my recycle bin; items that I had cleared out already. In fact I had cleared them out  put others in and then cleared *them* out as well. I checked the work I had done on the app I'm making and the work was gone. All my data seems to have reverted back to where it was 2 hours ago; no sign of the audio file I created  a .txt file I wrote  all the changes to the Godot project  it all just completely went back in time. All apart from the system / Linux application updates I did using the Update Manager. They are all still up to date.  I had already exported the app to my phone so I have proof I didn't dream making changes. Does anyone have any idea what on earth could have happened? I don't mind redoing the work but I am concerned it may happen again  after doing more substantial work. If it was just a file registry hadn't updated and it was resurrecting files that had been marked to be written over I wouldn't be so confused but I *changed* files and those changes were completely reverted. I have Timeshift but it's not setup to make any copies by itself and has only one image that I made after my fresh install.  Anyone got any ideas??,neutral,2021-12-17

The hidden problem with Thinkpads is the unavailability of official replacement batteries,It's something people don't often think about when buying a laptop. You may be lucky and the battery might outlast the machine.   But in my case  5 years after getting a Carbon  the machine was still good but the battery had died. Fair enough  I thought  I'll just get a replacement battery. This was harder than I thought it would be. I tried a couple  and both were duds. And the same thing just happened to a relative. They had a T14 for 4 years  battery died  looked for a replacement  and just got duds.  I really hope Lenovo sorts this  as it doesn't make sense to get a high end laptop that'll be done when the battery goes after 4 years.,positive,2021-12-17

T490 rebooting when moved on angle after motherboard replacement,I just had my T490 motherboard replaced today by an IBM service guy (I have the onsite service plan  and they do service for Lenovo these days). The rear USB-C port was no longer charging reliably  and I figured I should get it fixed since I had paid for the warranty. While the machine was open  I also installed an extra 8 GB of Crucial RAM since I didn't want to open the machine myself. Anyway  it worked fine at first (and currently is as well  at least temporarily) but now when I move the machine around too much  it shuts down and reboots (although a couple of times when it shut down  I had to push the reset button to get it to power on). I texted the rep since I had his number  and we think something might be loose given that it only happens when I move the machine around  but he is not sure  and I will need to call Lenovo to get someone to come back. It's also possible that it's the memory I added  so I could try opening the case and removing it (the service guy had a heck of a time getting it pried open  but hopefully it will be easier the second time). Right now the machine is actually angled up on my legs and working  so it's not an issue of it not working when it's not perfectly straight  but I am being careful not to tilt it sideways.  Oh  and I ran quick system diagnostics  and they ran clean.  Any suggestions?,neutral,2021-12-16

Touchpad issue with my thinkpad [Thinkpad L15 Gen 2 AMD],Hey  so I just noticed today that my touchpad's surface is off and raised a bit on its lower-left corner (and correspondingly collapsed on its lower-right).  I have a Thinkpad L15 Gen 2 AMD that i bought ~2-3 months ago.  The TouchPad still senses movement  and the upper buttons work  however clicking the touchpad rarely does anything  and the portion of the surface that is raised up is very sturdy and basically unclickable  whereas the lower left is clearly collapsed and pressing it brings the touchpad lower still (not the entire touchpad  only the lower-eft portion of it)  I dont think it is an issue of the laptop  probably my manipulations what with me trying to always keep the edge clean by inserting a paper to clean it or whatever (i hate myself now btw)  I don't know how common this problem is and i dont know if i explained it clearly. I dont even know how i could go about taking a picture to showcase the issue  but hopefully I don't need to.  My questions are:  1- Does this issue have a simple fix? 2- Will I have to send it back to get it fixed? I am still on warranty until 10/14/2022  and i would prefer to maybe avoid doing this? but asking anyways just to cover all of the bases. 3- Also  is this issue going to get worse?   I guess i'd have more follow up questions if there isn't a simple fix  since i dont know the procedure to send it back etc (i dont even know if the logistics are positive right now [duration/how long it'll be gone etc etc]  i haven't contacted customer service or anything since i just noticed this.

I recall purchasing x220 with IPS screen (my first Thinkpad with IPS) that have old non-lid keyboard and ThinkLight long ago. By now I get used to new keyboards  but on newer slimmer Thinkpads I notice two common problems which I do not recall seeing on models that still had ThinkLight:   1) Scratches from keyboard keys  2) LED backlight bleeding / leaking from some parts of the edge of the display  Any practical ways to fix those? Maybe not completely  but significantly. I mean after they occurred.,neutral,2021-12-15

T480s stopped charging via Thunderbolt 3 USB-C Cable after upgrading it to Windows 11,"I've been using a T480s with a Thunderbolt 3 USB-C Dock (Gen1) for almost three years now. Always updating my drivers and firmware to the latest version available at SystemUpdate or Lenovo Vantage. No big issues with the TB3 dock except for the 3.5mm audio jack dying a year or so ago.  Last week  during a work trip  I decided to upgrade my Windows 10 setup to Windows 11. Everything went smooth.  Yesterday I got back home  connected the single USB-C TB3 dock cable to my notebook  and a couple of hours after I noticed the battery was draining even though Windows was reporting the ""Plugged in"" status in the tray icon  and if I hovered the ""new"" battery icon in Windows 11 it reads ""Charging"" (and I think it blinks between a charging and not charging status).  So long story short  I'm able to use all the peripherals via the TB3 dock  but it won't charge my T480s laptop using the same TB3 cable as usual  so I have to attach my regular AC adapter (I purchased the 65W ""slim"" version some time ago) in the second USB-C PD port to get the computer charging.

X1C9 keyboard is not ok for a 15 year of TP user,Just got a x1c9 in hand for about a week  with the spec of i5 16g 512g  FHD  LTE. I am loving everything about this machine except for the keyboard.   As a 15 year TP user  I have owned/assigned x60  X201  T410  X230  X1C3  X1C6  and have seen a lot of changes to the thinkpad design  w/o trackpad to larger trackpad  7 rows to 6 rows  4:3 to 16:10 to 16:9.  None of those changes bothered me for more than a week  I got used to everything within a week or so for all these generations. I consider myself quick adapter to things especially laptops.   However  this time  this keyboard  is giving me problem. I constantly miss some letters or type things in the wrong order for almost every word including when I am writing this post. I just can not explain it. I just can't.   Two months ago I joined a new company and I am assigned a HP elitebook  I did not even experience this problem while typing on that HP machine  the only reason made me want to buy this x1c9 is that HP does not have a proper trackpoint.   This is really something I can not explain  maybe the change of the aspect ratio made the keys layout slightly different than those 16:9 models? What I know for sure is this is not caused by the reduce of key travel  because very strike still feels great  very tactile  slightly better than the HP elitebook. But I can type much faster on the HP  X1C6  than on this machine.   It seems nobody mentioned this  just want to share this personal experience to potential buyers  pls do notice this before you set your mind into it.,positive,2021-12-16

Modern Thinkpad that runs cool?,tldr: I'm looking for a new thinkpad that I can comfortably use in my lap  after the last two gave off too much heat.  I come from a long line of thinkpads (I'm all about that trackpoint)  most recently a T495.   Looking for an upgrade with some more processing power and liking the color accuracy of the 16:10 4k screens  I picked up an X1 Extreme Gen 4. I returned that because  while it had plenty of cooling  all that hot air went out the back and was deflected by the full-length hinge directly down into my lap  making it uncomfortable to work with.  After that  I picked up an X1 Yoga Gen 6. I thought due to it's lower TDP and lack of dGPU it'd be better  but I'm also finding that unpleasant to use due to the low airflow and aluminum heat-conducting shell. According to my trusty thermocouple  under load the shell gets up to 104 degrees fahrenheit where it hits my legs  with the exhaust air topping 130 (for reference  my T495 in the same test didn't top 92 on the shell and 110 exhaust air). Even idling while browsing the web it gets noticably warm  which is unpleasant.   Before I return that one too  I thought I'd seek out advice. Is this going to happen with all modern thinkpads? Is there a model that has a 16:10 good-color-accuracy screen that I can use without overheating my lap? Or am I using the X1 Yoga wrong  and there's some mod that'll help?,neutral,2021-12-15

Ive got a 1 week old E14 - i3 10th   I played stress tests with prime95  Lenovo vantage  and happily I have seen everything is good.  &amp;#x200B;  until the last couple of hours  Cpu began thermal or power throttling so so so bad. It wont get past 60c (was peaking at 90c) no matter what. It never goes 100% utilization. EVEN with prime95  that took my cpu to 98c  now its 60c locked with prime95 working.  I opened XTU to stress test and it like  spammed 'power throttling'.  I thought maybe a sensor on the MB is stuck  I tried installing fresh windows installation  Nothing helps.  CPU its acting like 1/3 of its power. Anything else i can do?,positive,2021-12-17

2 x Thinkpads for Christmas (kids).,So  it’s about time my 2 sons got upgraded. I’m thinking that I’ll buy them each a Thinkpad for Christmas.  In the past I’ve always gone the second hand route for my kids. However seeing the price for the latest Thinkpad E14 Gen 3 I’m really thinking that this might be the beat option.  R7 5800  16GB ram  512 GB ssd  FHD IPS. Cost where I am is around 800 USD.  Is this the better choice compared to a second hand T series? They play a lot of older games and some indie games like Minecraft  Among Us  Terraria etc.  Let me know what you guys think.,negative,2021-12-15

T420 BT install not working,I recently bought a T420  and upgraded the screen  RAM  and put an fairly large SSD into it.

Reflashing P52s Thunderbolt Firmware  not working,Hi   I have a P52s that is charged via the USB-C / Thunderbolt port. It is normally always plugged in sitting on a desk. One day  the screen was dim and the laptop said it was only running on battery.  I tried a new charger  both USB-C ports nothing worked. I then came across the common Thunderbolt Firmware issue and how this is one of the symptoms.  The problem is the laptop won't charge and the battery is now dead. It is also out of warranty.  I've seen a few other posts about manually flashing the firmware with an external programmer  and I have a TL866ii plus and it supports the Winbond 25Q80DV chip. I also was able to download the firmware from the Lenovo site and flash it to the chip but this is not working.  If I erase the EEPROM the system boots and cycles between charging and not charging (This was before the battery went to 0%).  When I tried flashing the firmware from lenovo (bin file) the thunderbolt was just dead.  Normally in my experience  if an eeprom dies  it prevents writing new data to it  or fully erasing the chip. The eeprom on my board is able to be programmed and verifies OK  could this still be the problem? Is there some magic to flashing these bin files? (I did 0x00 pad them).  Most other people that have gone the manual flashing route were fixing a different Thunderbolt issue (where the machine wouldn't boot anymore with the BIOS setting change).  Any suggestions on next steps? I ordered a few replacement eeproms to swap out  but again I am not sure this will fix it.  Appreciate any help!,negative,2021-12-16

X1 Extreme Gen 4: Can it game? A brief review.,Just for those who question it... I've got a 3080/i9 setup. I run red dead redemption 2 with a combination of ultra and high settings at 1980x1200 resolution. It does about 40fps consistently (no drops  always looks smooth at all times) at those settings. I have a 4k screen. (I'm on linux/steam/proton  if that matters.)  Thermals don't cause performance degradation on extended gaming sessions.  Fans are present  but so  so much better than the Dell G5 5590 with rtx 2070 I was using before that I consider them ignorable. (Even that Dell on the lowest setting I could configure on Linux would be incredibly unpleasant fan noise  whereas the X1E4's fans are just the sound of air moving  no awful whining/high pitch noise.)  Just wanted to give a real world review for people who were unsure.  I have not repasted or modified anything on this laptop  fwiw. I think repasting would help  though  the core temps look pretty uneven to me  and codehusky showed in his review that repasting produced a significant improvement. Tempted to just leave it be  though  frankly--there's enough performance there as-is  and repasting can go wrong just as it can go right.,negative,2021-12-17
T430 forever?!!! Advice on next Laptop? What should I consider and look at next?,Hey ThinKstur's So.... Yea I plan on purchasing a newer laptop sometime next year.

I also want port options as well.  I would like to stick with a ThinKpad  but I am open for other options  because well I just feel like Lenovo aren't making them like they used too.  And I know damn well after I buy a new laptop they are gonna come out with some kind of limited edition throwback model laptop and I'm going to be aggravated at not waiting it out.  But I can't wait forever.  Any thing I should look at maybe consider? Thanks for the help.  Also I would like to have 2 drives in it some how whether its msata and another ssd or 2 ssd drives.

T14s Gen 2 Intel: touchpad erratic after resuming from S3 sleep,"I recently got myself a T14s Gen 2 Intel. Love the laptop  but have a blocking issue to keep it.  Since I dislike modern standby  as soon as I got my new T14s I changed the BIOS settings to S3 sleep  then installed Windows 10. Updated Windows to the latest update and feature packm and all the drivers to the latest. Running powercfg /a confirms that I have S3 and no S0  Problem is  every time my T14s resumes from sleep  the touchpad becomes erratic  as if it were operating on a slow sampling (it's a function of S0 modern standby that a touch device can go into lower sampling rates to save energy  but I'm not sue it's my issue)  My system is using the Microsoft precision touchpad driver  and that device has the following entries in device manager  ACPI\\SYNA800E\\4&amp;1ebb9327&amp;0   HID\\SYNA800E&amp;Col04\\5&amp;327fc1d&amp;0&amp;0003   HID\\SYNA800E&amp;Col03\\5&amp;327fc1d&amp;0&amp;0002   HID\\SYNA800E&amp;Col02\\5&amp;327fc1d&amp;0&amp;0001   HID\\SYNA800E&amp;Col01\\5&amp;327fc1d&amp;0&amp;0000   HID\\SYNA800E&amp;COL01\\5&amp;327FC1D&amp;0&amp;0000 is under ""mice and other pointing devices"" while the other 4 entries are under ""human interface devices"" with various names.

I also tried unchecking ""allow the computer to turnoff this device to save power"" in the driver entries  but that made no difference. I also looked in the registry to see if changing power options for those driver made a difference  but either I didn't do a good enough job or that doesn't work either  The only thing that works is to use Hibernate instead of Sleep. Of course that works  since the device goes thru a power cycle  and the touchpad is properly initialized. But I cannot use a modern laptop like a 25 years old machine with only hibernate instead of sleep...  Anything worth trying?

Thinkpad P52 Worth it?,Hi all   I am looking for a laptop that has almost as much power as my desktop has and have come across the ThinkPad P52.  The main features I like it about it compared to its older counterparts (the older p series and w series) are the 6 core processor and great graphics card. I am not interested in the newer versions because the battery is no longer hot-swappable (I have a P50 and T420 and I always carry multiple batteries with me).  Compared to other laptops I really like the fact that it is built like a ThinkPad  very durable  has good cooling  upgradability  etc.  I do have a few questions about it.  \- How is the battery life with the 1080p display when doing light tasks? I see people saying as low are 4 hours and some up to 13 hours.  \- Are there any major issues I should worry about (for example I heard of the thunderbolt problems with the T480  is there any problem like that on the P52?).  \- Can I swap the keyboard with a P50 keyboard? This probably sounds ridiculous but the reason I want to do this is because the Numpad section on the P50 I have volume controls  P52 keyboard has other controls there. I know I can remap the keys but I like having the key labels match the functions.  \- What would you say is an acceptable price for a P52 with an i7 8850H  P3200  and 1080p display (I don't care about storage and ram because I already have those ready).

One way to achieve the above is to buy a laptop with two SSD slots - one will have windows with MDM and the other will have linux and other private systems installed.  * **Size** \- 14 or 15 inches - it makes no difference to me * **Screen** \- 1080 seems ok  due to the effect on the battery  at home it works mainly with a connected monitor so it's not a problem (although 4k screens look great) * **RAM** \- here it would be nice to have a dual chanel up to 32 gb (future proof) * **Graphics** \- for my needs  an integrated one is enough (although it would be dedicated to a nice addition) * **Battery life** \- it would be nice for the laptop to last at least 6-7 hours - sometimes I work at the customer's premises without external power * **SSD** \- The ability to connect two disks from which you can boot the operating system (linux  windows  etc. - from both disk) * **Weight:** similar to the weight of my mac - ma 2 kg  I was thinking of getting a Thinkpad x1e gen 1 or 2 - new or used  but I can see that there are very mixed opinions about these models.  As for the sexy factor  x1 carbon is great - I am considering giving up the second drive and installing MDM on the main drive.  I still have access to a Thinkpad T480 in very good condition  I would have to buy a RAM  a new disk and check whether the system can be booted from the disk connected in place of the LTE modems.

Thinkpads and the Big One,"I've been using Thinkpads since the 90's and fondly remember great models like the original 720  600  500  T2x series  X1's and then shudder with the more shall we say ""interesting family members"" like the 701 butterfly  or the 755cv (Which would allow you to take the back off the screen so you could use it on an overhead projector).  But when we talk about big ""Thicc"" ThinkP'90sads and people bring up the photo of the fake ThinkPad with the VHS player and the ethernet switch  I always think about the big Thinkpad 770  which in my opinion is the King of Chonky Thinkpads or as a Pixar character once said ""The Big One"".

I have the 6th gen X1 Carbon and am considering getting the P14s next year. Is the WWAN slot also able to work as a secondary SSD?,I was able to use the shorter 2242 M.2 PCIe slot in my X1 that is meant to hold the WWAN module as a secondary storage drive (btw if anyone is planning on doing this  be sure to get a NVMe drive that has the storage only on one side)...  &gt;Also  anecdotally  a lot of people online answer this question without knowing the answer. The 6th generation X1 Carbon has two M.2 PCIe slots and both support storage.

Is it also just a normal M.2 PCIe slot like on the X1 Carbon? I would be getting the Gen 2 (if Gen 3 doesn't get surprise-released next year)...

I love my T430 ThinKPad,I have been doing a lot of backing up and cleaning of files on my computer the past few days. I mostly save everything to external drives to keep most my files easy to move and keep my computer running with just programs i need and not much else. I got my first ThinKPad last year right before the pandemic. I bought 6 of them actually. Got laid off from work so I looked for a little hustle which in turn got my through the year and part of the pandemic. A simple older laptop.  I fixed em up ram them for a few days and eventually kept one for myself.  Put an ssd in all of them had 4gb 8gb and 16gb ram set ups. So if people wanted to negotiate I’d offer the lower end or middle priced ones. Eventually sold them all turned 300$ plus hard drives into a little bank roll.  Although I couldn’t find em for that price again I bought 4-6 or more at a time on eBay. Same thing ssd ram resell. Of course I cleaned em up some needed the hard drive covers or ram covers or batteries. But I factored in those costs before purchasing. I had in my mind 100$ to get it together and resell it for 200$ or more. Sometimes itd cost a little more to have it together maybe 120ish sometimes. But I sold about 240-250 laptops in a year during the pandemic. It got me through the year with bills and finances. I use my ThinKPad everyday. I have it docked like a desktop speaker plugged into it  3external ssd hard drives plus another dock for 2 more hard drives from the computers I replaced. I eventually sold those hard drives wiped for 10$ each. I grew to love ThinKPads and I never thought it would be my daily over my mbp early 2011. The backlit keyboard always blew my mind on that. Then I saw that they had em for this…. Swapped it and yea…. It’s my daily for the last 2 years. I put another drive where the cd rom was as well. But all the ports all the options just a perfect laptop for me. Will they ever make laptops like this again? Everything I look at is just sooo soldered together no changing anything no plug in options. I love this computer it is a little sluggish at times but looking at upgrading in the next year or 2 nothing captures me like this T430 does.,negative,2021-12-15

W530 screen abnormalities,"Hi all   I recently started using my W530 again (Type 2447  but with 32 GB of RAM)  and I noticed something bizarre while I went through the Lagom LCD calibration / test patterns. The subpixel-layout one had zero black lines  on any of the sides of the square.  The page mentioned that if the screen isn't RGB subpixels  that the text wouldn't work  so I got my eyeball about an inch or 1.5 inches from the screen  and could clearly make out the individual pixels  but no subpixels at all. No RGB subpixels  or CYM subpixels.  I tried looking for a possible OLED screen that's a drop-in replacement  and found nothing there. I will admit  I got two of these machines  and this one had FAR better colours  but all other aspects of the two were the same (viewing angles  etc.)  It's clear that this is NOT the factory screen  but if it's not RGB  and not CYM  what could it be? I do know that most of the entire panel gets quite hot when at maximum brightness  and that even dropping the brightness by one notch adds almost 25% more runtime  but I'm not sure if standard LCDs do that as well.

T440p charging issue after motherboard replacement,So the motherboard on my T440p went bad  not exactly on its own... but due to me being an idiot and forgetting to remove the battery when flashing the BIOS chip... Stupid mistake  I know and I've learned my lesson to be more careful.   Anyway  I took the L  ordered a new mobo and put it in. Now the laptop lives again  although something seems to be wrong with the power adapter and the symptoms are quite inconsistent  so I would appreciate some help figuring out what exactly is wrong.    The first time I booted into Win 10 with the new motherboard and connected the charger  I got a notification saying something about the power adapter not being recognized  but then it would start charging regardless. After that  it shut down and kept shutting down every time I plugged the adapter in. So I started searching on the internet - so far I've verified that the charger outputs the correct voltage (20 V) with absolutely no drops or spikes  and also that this voltage gets all the way to the motherboard (which should by my logic rule out the charging port itself being bad). I've also found out that the laptop seems to charge fine when it's powered off. So I let it charge for a couple hours and now it no longer shuts off when I connect the charger while powered on - instead the power LED flashes 4-5 times  but it doesn't start charging either. One more thing I'm considering is updating the BIOS  but my trauma with Thinkpad BIOS might still too fresh for that  lol. And the reason I'm considering that is the new motherboard has v2.51 and my old mobo was definitely on a newer version  probably 2.55   Just to be more specific  both the old and the new motheboards are with the Nvidia dGPU and I'm running an i7-4710MQ.

Ignored my bosses advice and ordered a X1 Carbon Gen 9 instead of a T14 Gen 2 (company pays). Did I fuck up?,"He said he had a X1C previously and it was a nightmare to use and he much prefers his 4 year old T470 that he got it replaced with and that the X1C was incredibly slow for doing coding and compilation. He told us I'm meeting that we should avoid the carbons at all costs when due a replacement laptop.  I work as a programmer using visual studio mostly.  I looked at the specs for both of my choices and   - The T14 had a i5-1145G7  2.6GHz  16GB RAM and 1080p screen.  - The X1C has a 1200p (16:10) screen  an i7-1185G7  3.0 GHz  16GB of RAM.  Bot have the same port selection pretty much. So reasonably it seems like it should perform as well as the T14.   I looked at reviews and the X1C has good reviews and I got a bit of a rush of blood to the head and said ""fuck it  order the expensive thin one with the nicer screen. The boss probably just had a bad unit  and I couldn't justify buying a laptop this nice with my own money"".    The purchase order is already gone through so if I did fuck up there's no going back. But I am wondering if anyone else *actually* had similar problems with an X1C being very slow and bad for programming on (particularly VS)?   Is there a real reason I should have avoided the X1C?

X1 Extreme Gen 4 DPC (ACPI.sys) latency issues - Workaround Thread,"Hello!  It is crazy how after all these years Lenovo hasn't addressed this issue on this flagship productivity laptop. OK  the blame is 50% Lenovo and 50% Microsoft (who even in Windows 11  their ACPI driver is responsible for DPC latency in many laptops today).  When I run LatencyMon  I am getting high latencies. The ACPI driver contributes the most to the latency. As you know  this results in low performance  especially in time-critical applications like audio and video production.  So now  unlike other Laptop owners  we have to spend hours in fine-tuning our system to save a few microseconds here and there. It is a bit ridiculous.  I was hoping to get together with other X1 owners and gather our intel on ways to elimiate the DPC latency.  The approach I have so far that gives me the lowest latency in LatencyMon is:  1. Install Windows 11 from scratch 2. Install all updates 3. Uninstall all unecessary software 4. System &gt; Power &amp; Battery &gt; Power Mode: Best Performance 5. Install the Realtek audio driver from the Lenovo support website (because the one installed by windows is buggy) 6. Install the latest NVidia drivers from Lenovo 7. Do not install the Intel Graphics drivers from Lenovo as they increased the latency in my case (just keep the ones you already have)  &amp;#x200B;  With these settings I am getting ""Your system seems suitable"" results in Latency monitor. ACPI peaked at around 750 microseconds after 20+ minutes of monitoring while browsing on the internet at the same time. (peaked at around 400 microsecs while doing nothing).  &amp;#x200B;  I will keep updating this as I find more solutions that work.   Would love to hear your tips on this problem! Let's see if we can collectively sort this out!  &amp;#x200B;  P.S. I know there are countless generic DPC latency optimization guides out there  but different things work on different laptops and I think it would be useful for other Thinkpad owners.  &amp;#x200B;  P.S.2 No changes needed for the BIOS using this guide. I think you could get some more juice if you disabled intel sidestep and other features.",neutral,2021-12-17
Any Linux way to flash UEFI BIOS from downloaded CD ISO image from USB? Re: thunderbolt issue.,"I've read about issues [https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/etv3kp/lenovo\_statement\_thunderbolt\_firmware\_responsible/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/etv3kp/lenovo_statement_thunderbolt_firmware_responsible/)   checked BIOS date (2018) and decided to try to update. By the way  does downloaded BIOS update includes replacement for thunderbolt firmware? I do not state my model specifically because I might buy another one  I see many here have several Thinkpads btw ;-)    I'm stuck now. Linux distros now come in hybrid iso formats and can be ""easily"" written to usb sticks and booted. But Lenovo supplies BIOS firmware in ISO that is pure CD ISO 9660 format and it not bootable. I've tried first to just write it to stick  then Ventoy  then Etcher (found recommendation today in some web article) - out of luck. How to make bootable stick to update firmware?   Though less preferred way would be to run those three cab files from archive for Linux. Accompanying txt  instructions are lengthy but I have not found there an info whether sequence of their processing matters  to use fwupdmgr or fwupdtool etc. Thanks!",positive,2021-12-16

Thinkpad t420s as basis for project ?,Hello Everyone !  I have a small question. I want to work on a small project: I want to build a custom ARM laptop. My objectives are to build something simple  solid  kind of modular (I want use a SBC like a  raspberry pi zero as a basis but being able to change to a raspberry pi4 without thinkering too much would be a big plus) and with a very good battery life (15 hours). I can get a t420s for very little and the idea would be to use it as a basis and gut the main components (only keep the chassis  the screen and the keyboard/touchpad)  and use third party components to control the peripherals I need.  I also do have some coding and electronic skills/knowledge and have some equipement for project like these (powertools  soldering station  multimeter  voltage generators  Arduinos  etc) I am also very aware that this is a project that could take some weeks of work and this doesn't scare me.   I believe this project seems quite doable  without much difficulty (but still quite a lot of work). From what I have seen  I would need the following: * LCD controler [Link]https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/4000067071998.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.361028fe6TMWgh&amp;algo_pvid=924a1714-f952-4c7c-9b67-c9383bb58a7b&amp;algo_exp_id=924a1714-f952-4c7c-9b67-c9383bb58a7b-3&amp;pdp_ext_f=%7B%22sku_id%22%3A%2210000000173173841%22%7D) * Keyboard controler [Something like this](https://hackaday.com/2014/04/30/using-a-thinkpad-keyboard-over-usb/) * Battery controllers (For charge/discharge + 5V/12V outputs) * Speakers (Audio Output) * Connectivity (USB + charging ports)  So my questions are:  * Is the T420s a good basis for a project like this ? * Is there any good documented attempt on a project like this ?

X1 C6 - whea_uncorrectible_error - Overheating?,"Hi All   I've had a X1C6 for about three years now and overall it's been a great machine. I did have the fan unit replaced under warranty about a year ago because the machine seemed to be overheating and crashing during zoom calls  but that seemed to fix the issue.  But just over the past week  I've been getting multiple BSOD crashes  with a ""whea\_uncorrectable\_error"" - usually when I'm just running Word or doing some other simple task.  I ran all the built-in diagnostics  but found nothing. However  running HWinfo shows that the temperatures often get hot - all 4 cores getting up into the very high 90s  even when just running MS Word and nothing else. Though it's inconsistent - they'll hover in the 50s and then spike up to the 90s and sit there with no change in w I'm doing or running on the machine. See a typical report below (when the machine was cooler  but showing those spikes.  The fan's also often spinning up and spinning down when the laptop's not under any real load.   Any ideas what's going on here or approaches I could take to diagnose? Or if that's even the reason for the BSODs?

Debugging T440p Power Adaptor revision  Windows 10 ACPI drivers   Power Source Change Event 105 showing up randomly problem,"Hi all   Does anyone know where I can find ""changelog"" for Lenovo Power adapters. Or how does those two differ?    Top one is ""revision 100"" from 2013 (aka old one)   Bottom one is ""revision 500"" from 2015 (ak new one)   **Problem:** Old T440p laptop (i7-4710MQ) installed Windows 10 21H2 (all patched up + all patches thru Vantage app) have been ""blinking"" the screen (dim in / dim out) the same way when you disconnect the power supply. This was happening at random  without any load (iddling) and in random time spans. Battery  despite years  was reported to be ok  holds hours of charge.   Intial investigation showed that ""screen blinking"" is connected to Even 105 - Power source changed  that is showed in Windows event viewer. Laptop  connected to **old power adapter** was dropping AC charging for half a second (screen dims) and then get back to AC charging (screen brightens up). Battery level and build in ""charging threshold"" were not the case here. The same goes for Airplane mode which did not solve the problem (enabling  disabling etc).   Issue have not propagated on Windows Server 2019 installed on the device  neither on Ubuntu booted from USB stick. So I digged deeper:  On Windows 10 21H2 disabling in Device Manager both *Microsoft AC Adapter* and *Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method battery* solved the problem  however I lost the battery percentage readout. any and every trick that I found online in regards of ""pull the battery  restart device  work on ac for some time etc"" have not solved ""blinking""-power-source-changed problem. Disabling (not removing) those two items in device manager caused to stop issue from happening. Thus I conclude this is not ""failed batter"" or ""failed AC"" issue.   In meantime I was looking for some other AC to plug T440p to and found **new AC** (revision 500) power adapter. Plugging it in solved the ""blinking"" problem.   **In summary:**  Same spec and same model AC adapters (Lenovo part: 130093-11 / ADL135NLC3A) - 135W slim plug behave in two different ways  depending on operating system and installed/enabled Microsoft AC Adapter / Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery.  **Questions:**   1. Does anyone know why? 2. Or is there a way to further debug this without disassembling the AC?  3. Does those ac have some comm capabilities over power lines that allow them to ""talk"" to mainboard of the laptop?  4. I wildly assume those power adapters dont get any firmware updates ? ;)       https://preview.redd.it/uckbrppmj5581.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a7ab489abcc27f6980f21160b5bb16ee0a296c8",negative,2021-12-15

I need a good reliable laptop for University and the main use case would be Office  Zoom  Web browsing and occasionally Netflix.

X1 Extreme Gen 4 - Best Airplane Charging Option?,So  it is confirmed that at least the X1E4's that ship with the 170 watt charger can take a 100 watt usb-c power delivery charge (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/r4hjp6/charging_thinkpad_x1_extreme_gen_4_with_usbc_pd/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/p3zsml/the_x1_extreme_gen_4_charges_from_100w_usb_c_but/)). In fact  that last link claims some 120 watt PD worked (I thought 100 watt was the max for usb-c pd?).  Commentary on getting various other lenovo slim tip chargers working seems weirdly unclear/mixed?  I have a 230 watt charger variants (rtx 3080)  though  and I see even less info about this model. I can disable the dgpu  though if I'm on an 11 hour flight  I might be interested in gaming to whatever extent is possible  if possible.  Also  planes are a mixed bag in terms of what they allow with charger draw. From what I [read](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/p3zsml/comment/h8yes76/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  about half of flights they took allowed their 130 watt dell charger to work  half did not.

MX Linux is my daily driver OS since 2 years  so I think Thinkpad can be the right choice.     Requirements:   1) connect dual monitor (UWQHD \[via USB-C\] + FullHD \[via HDMI\]). If not possible  connect at least the UWQHD monitor.   2) decent battery life with linux (I will use it more time as a desktop replacement but sometimes I would to work from antoher place  so a minimum battery life is required)   3) minimum FullHD monitor (IPS??)   4) storage-ram expandable (if possible)   5) buy it used (ebay auction  etc.). I would not buy it as new.   6) lightweight   7) Budget: no idea.   I would sell che GPU  so budget start from 300€ (minus).   Minimum performance must be like the desktop pc so...I just prefer to buy the cheap as possible.,negative,2021-12-16

Lenovo - Please consider this configuration for next years lineup,"In the last year I've bought two different ThinkPads. The first was an X1 Extreme Gen 2  the second was a T14 Gen 2 (AMD). I bought the T14 because I just couldn't get the X1E working in a satisfactory way with Linux. Not Lenovo's fault exactly  but Nvidia's proprietary drivers.  The T14 Gen 2 has been near flawless for me  but it's still not quite what I would consider perfect. The 14"" screen is just a bit too small for my eyes and the soldered memory limits me to 32GB if I want all the RAM to be running with dual channel speeds. Everything else is quite good. A single NVME slot is also a bit limiting  but not a huge deal  really.  So  Lenovo  if you're listening  I'd love to see a machine like this next year. I'd buy it the day it was released (well  the first day there was a sale on it anyway)  I believe it would probably fit into your P line.  * 15.6 - 16"" screen  16:10 aspect ratio  4K or 1080P * Slotted memory  none of of this soldered in stuff * Ryzen Pro 9 6xxx series (I know they're not out yet  but when they are...) with built in Radeon graphics (this will make sure it works with Wayland next year when all the distros migrate to it) * Dual NVME slots * WLAN slot (optional  but would be nice to have) * Multiple USB C slots  on both sides of the laptop * Standard USB 3.1 ""A"" slot (at least one) * SD Card Reader * Fingerprint reader * Nice X1E style chassis with the carbon/tungsten composition * Linux compatible BIOS  As long as it doesn't have Nvidia discrete graphics  it would be great. That's been my biggest pain point on the X1 Extreme. Most of the time when I'm working I have it connected to an ultrawide monitor (3840x1600) so I need Wayland to adjust the display scaling on each monitor individually  which you can't do with X. Wayland with Nvidia is not ideal.  Screenshot.",negative,2021-12-17

NVME Drive Death? Is that Possible?,So two days ago my computer (X1 Carbon gen 9) went to sleep and when I turned it on  the screen was black. Turned it on and off and screen was still black  wouldn't even connect to an external monitor or show logo at startup! I thought the graphics were dead  so I went to take out the nvme drive to backup my files. I got an adapter to plug the drive into my desktop  but it wasn't showing up. Strangely enough  when I booted the computer without the drive  the bios logo displayed! It said however that it was running off of a backup bios. Is the BIOS stored on the NVME drive on x1 carbon gen 9? Is that a thing? When I took a look at the drive  some parts looked a little discolored on the black PCB.  Also  the screws holding in the drive were really  really  hard to take out. Almost stripped them. Just a heads up to other X1 Carbon Gen 9 owners.,negative,2021-12-17

L520 stiff hinges problem,"Dear ThinkPad community   I have a problem with my L520 that I bought used a few days ago. When I received it  the hinges were normal or even a bit on the loose side  opening was very easy and could be done with one hand.   Now 2 weeks later  the hinges became much stiffer and the right hinge started creaking  but only a little bit. Also  the screen bezel lifts away from the panel a little bit (1/2 mm) when I open the lid. The parts of the lid that are ""on the outside of the hinges"" are a bit tilted upwards but that was already when I received it.  Now I'd like to try and ""repair"" the hinges. I've read somewhere that the L520-hinges can be tightened and loosened  so my plan is to disassemble the hinges  clean them with isopropyl alcohol  reassemble  re-lubricate with Ballistol or something similar as well as re-adjust them.  Has anyone had the same issue or has tips on what to do? Would only lubricating be a better idea?   A few weeks ago I bought a T61 which had very stiff hinges to begin with and 3 days later  it became so stiff that the lid edges ripped open  tearing the lid and screen bezel apart. Thankfully I could return the T61. However  I have no returning option for the L520.  TL;DR  L520 hinge were normal  2 weeks later stiff to the point of cracking noises.

Thank God for ThinkPads,Just here to share a quick story about how owning a ThinkPad saved my bacon today.  I'm currently finishing up my first year of law school. I took some time off between undergrad and now  but I bought a T480 new because I knew I would want to have a really good machine that I could rely on for work and for school for years at a time. And of course because of the excellent keyboards. I like to type hard and fast  which makes ThinkPads the only option for me.  Over the years  I've upgraded the hard drive and added RAM  and put this thing through daily abuse. Recently  my Enter key began sticking and my S keycap was finally busted. This was not ideal: we're currently having exams and they all require typing. For a lot of laptops on the market  a busted key would have required either a custom keycap that would take weeks to ship  or possibly even a whole new computer that would drain my finances.  Fortunately  I own a ThinkPad. Fixing this thing is just so easy. I found a replacement keyboard on Amazon that was Prime-eligible  and it arrived overnight. Tonight I swapped it in during a ten minute surgery and voila  I have a machine that feels good as new and is ready to take on all of my final exams abuse.   The moral here is that I'm glad I bought the machine that I did. Otherwise I would have been kinda screwed during the most important week of the year. Thanks  ThinkPad. Keep doing you.,neutral,2021-12-15

ThinkPad vs Gaming Laptops,I entered the world of ThinkPads with the P50 back in 2016 mainly for the build quality as my previous two laptops had physically disintegrated. The P50 is one of my best purchases ever (after switching to a better screen). It is still going strong and runs just as good as new. The only reason I'm considering getting a new laptop is because I game occasionally and the M1000M GPU is showing its age.

Of course  better specs are always appealing  but I am also concerned about the build quality  keyboard  cooling  etc  that tend to be ThinkPads biggest selling points.

X230 two batteries that won't charge,I got a ThinkPad X230 which I've used with the battery it came with. After some time my OS couldn't read fhe charge % anymore and the battery didn't seem to charge properly anymore. I could use the x230 with the charger plugged in so I figured the battery is the problem. Ordered a replacement battery from Aliexpress but it has the same problem.

Don’t buy the Ultimate N 6300 network card,I never flashed the BIOS on my t430  so my choices were the 6205 (2x2) and 6300 (3x3). With the 6300  either in Linux or windows  I was getting only max 80-100 mbps down (it’s rated for 450 mbps down max). An external USB adapter (300mbps max) was getting me 225 mbps down.  I just popped in a 6205 and it’s similar to the external. I think there is a bug in the intel drivers (either iwlwifi or win) that will likely never be fixed.

i5 vs. i7 on X1 Nano for general use? or X1 Carbon Gen 9?,I posted a couple of days ago that I had bought an X1C Gen9  but after doing some more research  I think I am leaning towards the X1 Nano.  Have searched this sub a bunch but was hoping to get some more opinions since I am kind of driving myself insane trying to decide what laptop to keep:  I am a one computer person and my laptop will stay plugged into a dock powering an external display  speakers  keyboard  etc. 95% of the time.  That said  when I travel  I care about screen resolution  battery life  and lightness - primarily this is so I can just travel with one machine (laptop vs. laptop + tablet) to watch movies and stuff while on a flight.  Most of my use when I am at my desk is web browsing  email  productivity software  video conferencing  and light photo editing.  No gaming or virtual machines for me.  Somehow I've now found myself having ordered 4 different laptops.  I need to decide what to keep and I'm kind of torn:  * MacBook Air M1 w/ 16gb of RAM  1 TB SSD (what I'm currently using  have decided that I miss Windows more than I thought I would - planning on returning it once I decide on a ThinkPad) * X1C Gen 9 w/ i7  16gb of RAM  1 TB SSD  matte FHD+ non-touch display (on order  hasn't arrived yet) * X1 Nano w/ i5  16gb of RAM  1 TB SSD  2K screen (arrived today) * X1 Nano w/ i7  16gb of RAM  1 TB SSD  2K screen (arrives Monday)  I played around with the X1 Nano i5 for a bit when it arrived today.  Overall impressions are great - keyboard is fantastic  screen looks good  the size is amazing and it's absurdly light.  I tried to mimic my daily workflow - working in Excel while streaming some video  powering a 4K display  etc. and the i5 seemed to handle it ok  although I noticed a couple choppy frames on the fullscreen video I was streaming  and the fan seemed to run the entire time I was using it.  Not super scientific but in task manager  CPU usage seemed to hover around 60% with a fair number of spikes up to 100% briefly when I was opening/closing applications  etc.  which seemed high to me for just daily use.  Right now I think I am leaning towards the X1 Nano with the i7 over the i5  my thought process being that since I'll be using it plugged in at a desk most of the time  the extra drain that the i7 would have on battery life is worth it for the extra performance.  Has anyone gone with the i5 and wished they'd gotten the i7 instead  or vice versa?  In terms of the X1 Nano i7 vs. the X1 Carbon Gen 9 i7  the biggest thing is the screen on the Nano seems to be much better.  The extra portability is nice for traveling as well  but again  I'll be using it at a desk most of the time  so it's tough to know heavily to weight that  and the X1C is certainly not a huge machine by any stretch  and the X1C seems to be a little bit more powerful (although not sure how noticeable that would be) and perhaps has slightly better battery life.  The differences in price and port selection don't matter to me all that much.  Anyways  if you've read this far  thank you - would appreciate any thoughts as I just want to make sure I'm making the right choice.,positive,2021-12-15

Aspiring full stack developer  help me upgrade my t480 plz,Hey folks  new to this world of thinkpads and coding so please be gentle with me haha. Just purchased a second hand thinkpad t480 i7-8650U 16gb ram 512gb ssd Waiting for it to arrive for further inspection of the components.  Long story short  looking to become a self taught full stack developer. Have dabbled in code lightly in the past but didn't have the tech for it. Used a friend computer.  The reason I purchased a thinkpad t480 based on all of your recommendations here is because I'm moving from UK to Western Australia within the next 6 months and needed portability. I was previously considering enrolling to go to uni there to become electrical/mechanical engineer but pretty unimpressed with the starting salary of $69k+ and too impatient to go to uni for 5+ years.   Bear in mind I am currently working as operations manager in the UK with a salary of £34k+ per year and can transfer into a similar job role in WA from $110k+  However my heart is not in the  job and I really enjoy coding from what I've played with in the past along with the problem solving aspects of it. The other aspiration is I prefer working alone and would like to gain remote employment/part time remote work where I can spend some time at home don't mind visiting the office now and again.  The starting salary is around $100k+ as a software developer/engineer which is much more realistic in WA based on my research on seek.  I'm pretty thankful I can learn things very fast because my brain is like 25+ chrome tabs open all at once and feel like the physical aspect of life is like sitting in the slow lane so I feel like this is up my street and throughly enjoy being consistently challenged and learning new things all the time.  Once I have developed the skills necessary and hopefully gain employment in this field I may consider studying additional engineering degree/s at home further down the line.   I wanted to start saving and upgrade my t480 to be the best workhorse it can be to help me develop my skills over the next 2 years so there's no limited budget. Can you tell me what parts I should save to buy and upgrade for the best performance possible?   Currently employers in Australia are looking for these skills of .NET core ASP Net MVC . Net framework SQL HTML5 Angular 2 CSS Javascript C# C++ Python Django  I have got a rough plan to learn these skills step by step starting with python and HTML however any advice will be helpful.

X1 Carbon gen 6 battery falls overnight after shutting down.,Hi   I've had an x1c6 for about almost 2 years now. Bought in jan 2020 used while it was only 17 hours used. Ive had a battery threshold on for almost all that time on 80 percent max and starts charging at 75. My cycle could today is 119 I think.  During this time i was dual booting macos and windows 10. I did run into issues with my windows as it would check disk during startup and so a few months ago i formatted my macos partition.  A month ago i upgraded to windows 11 by clean installing and i noticed the battery would go from 80 to 72.  I downgraded back to windows 10 with a clean install from the official microsoft site.

Best bang-for-your-buck  used Thinkpad for 300€ max?,"Hello   my current laptop (an X230) is on its last legs and i think I'm due for an update.

First steps with Thinkpad p14s,Hi   I joined the gang.

I do have a 2TB SSD in the mail that should arrive tomorrow or Monday.  Is there anything valuable on the 'factory' provided SSD? Do I have to make a copy of the partition somehow and transfer it to the new disk or I'm fine starting from scratch? (I'm thinking any special drivers or settings Lenovo adds  licence should just be automatic anyway)  Am I supposed to do a BIOS update? I'm confused I didn't find any Lenovo software. I don't like bloatware generally but I would assume they have their own software that can check and install things like new BIOS  trackad driver  whatever special things the notebook has over the average Windows drivers. Is that a thing or I shouldn't care?  I would like to install Linux  going for something newbie friendly but also desktop friendly (so not archaic) so I thought maybe Mint (i hate ubuntu and just tolerate debian)  or perhaps Manjaro. For ideological reasons I don't like Fedora (not a systemd fan) but I would also consider it. Any of these  or simialr distros I should excpect to work fine out of the box? I do have a realtek wifi but I ordered an Intel ax210 as well after reading a bit.  Not so much Thinkpad question but I am new to Uefi  is there anything special if I want a dual boot Win10/Linux or just install Windows normally on a certain partition size and then install Linux and I should not worry about boot managers screwing each other? Normally I use a desktop  this will be my not so main and not so critical mobile general purpose computer  I want to test drive Linux as 'daily driver' (set it up with everything I need while not relying on it too much in the beginning) while also keeping a Windows because I visit family and tend to need to do tech support for them.

AX200 Cards &amp; Dropouts under linux,This is my second thinkpad with an AX200. Both cards do the same thing.  When throughput gets too high the card drops off. I can't ping the gateway. Appears to be still connected but no traffic is received. The log says:   *iwlwifi 0000:03:00.0: reached 10 old SN frames from xx:xx:ma:c on queue 4  stopping BA session on TID 0*  If I disconnect and re-connect wifi is back. Sucks because it happens randomly and especially watching HD youtubes. Both of the cards in my thinkpads do this. One is ubuntu  the other arch.

The cursed Synaptics touchpad,"I got myself a T460  all is well except for one thing that's driving me insane: the Synaptics touchpad. [Here's an analysis from a libinput dev.](https://who-t.blogspot.com/2016/09/libinput-and-lenovo-t450-and-t460.html) Previously  in other laptops I've had issues described in the first part of that post  with an unreachable grid of touchpad pixels making pointer movement imprecise  which was solved by adding a linux kernel parameter:      psmouse.synaptics_intertouch=0  thus switching from PS/2 to SMBus. The second part of that post is more relevant here. The touchpad stops properly tracking finger movement when it becomes too slow and doesn't leave some small rectangle in a certain (short) period of time  then resumes tracking once it does leave it. From what I've gathered – there's no fixing it  it's baked into the firmware.  So I like touchpads – when they're precise  I often recompile libinput in order to remove precision-inhibiting bits from it (ones they like to call ""noise cancellation""  ""wobbling""  ""motion hysteresis"")  and now I'm in the market for a new touchpad by ALPS  or anyone other than Synaptics  and I would like someone to tell me what they're like (on linux and only on linux) and if any of this nonsense affects them too.",positive,2021-12-17

ThinkPad P52 overheating when e.g. decompressing files?,"Hi all. I was able to acquire a ThinkPad P52 for what I think was a good deal some weeks ago. It's great! But it seems to have an issue with overheating.  -  My relevant(?) specifications are as such:  - CPU: i7-8850H - GPU: NVIDIA P2000 - RAM: 16 GB - OS: Pop!\_OS (Ubuntu) 21.10 hirsute  I don't have TLP  TPFanControl  or anything of the sort installed  as far as I know. Just the stock OS  for the most part.  I usually have the dGPU disabled in favor of the iGPU  via Pop!_OS. I don't really do anything graphics-intensive besides the occasional game.  -  When doing basic tasks - browsing the web with Microsoft Edge  using LibreOffice  etc. (no product placement  I swear) - the CPU package (as reported by `lm-sensors`) generally hovers around 40°C. The computer is silent and cool to the touch  which is great.  However  when extracting many or large files  the temperature increases to almost 100°C  and the fans ramp up considerably. Hot air is blown out of the rightward vent. This can be seen when running `apt upgrade` with 20 or more packages in the queue  for example.  Running `apt update`(!) and having Discord automatically update causes this as well  though not as severely; the CPU temp reaches around 70°C when doing so.  Rendering video and starting Minecraft(!?) causes a similar problem  but that's to be expected; my desktop does the same.  I tried changing ""Adaptive Thermal Management"" &gt; ""Scheme for AC"" in the BIOS settings menu from ""Maximize Performance"" (reduced CPU throttling) to ""Balanced"" - I use my laptop while it's plugged in  for the most part - but that didn't seem to help.

What is the time on battery for the largest new Thinkpad T61 battery?,Hi   I got some money and I love the t61. But it has only 2gb of ram and a dead battery.   I really love it and use it  but I want the most battery life I want and my current laptop - yoga 510-14ast - has like 3h for me the most.   Like I said  I love the t61  I think it has better display outside  it has better connectivity  I have a dock for it  the keyboard is better  it had DVD burner (I'll need that for my graduation) and other neat things.   But still  if it has less than 3-4h I'll rather do something with my new laptop and try to save that one for later.

What should the Carbon X1 (6th Gen) average temperatures be in different states? + Battery Question,One month ago  my Lenovo Carbon X1 (6th Gen)'s thermal paste was re-pasted  its fan and heat sink cleaned  and a motherboard part controlling the fan was fixed. My laptop is 2.5 - 3.5 years old.  I have 20 tabs open (most are hopefully idle) on Brave browser while unplugged  and my CPU temperatures over around 50-53 C. While my laptop is charging  it gets hotter.  What should be normal average temperatures in different states?  Also  if the battery capacity runs low  is it okay if I constantly keep my laptop plugged in and set the maximum charge to 80%  or would that ruin my laptop and it'd just be better to just do a battery replacement?

ThinkPad P14s Gen 2 - Screen Response times,Hi all   After further consideration  I decided that a P14s would have been a better fit for me vs a E14 G3. I bought it on black friday at a 40% discount  and I configured it with a 400 nit LP display  as I heard the ePrivacy screen sucked and this gave better battery life.  I knew there was a chance I would get a BOE panel (NE140FHM-61 in HWINFO)  which has 70ms response times  but I did not expect it to be this bad. There is terrible ghosting  even when writing text on a bright white background  and my eyes get fatigued after viewing eventually. Even icons are a smeary mess when opening the start menu or just moving the cursor on a dark background.  Is there a way to fix this somehow via support  to get a panel without noticeable PWM flickering and somewhat decent response times (ie an Innolux or LG)? I like this notebook in every other way  it runs cool and has long battery life. I would rather not replace the display myself.   Thanks!,positive,2021-12-15
How much RAM do you use on a regular basis and what are you running?,Last year  I bought myself a P53 and went nuts on RAM with 128 GB. I thought it was overkill but now I'm starting to realize that I actually need it. My old computer has 32 GB and it was constantly swapping.  My RAM usage easily exceeds 70 GB on a typical day. I don't like closing apps because it takes a while to start these apps and configuring them and running them over and over again. Unfortunately  I must keep my laptop plugged all the time because I can't get more than 1:30 hours of runtime.  I don't typically use multiple desktops  my taskbar is my best friend. I have increased the size to two rows because of how many windows are open.  I'm a freelance writer but also have to run software environments to document them.  This is what a typical day looks like for me:  * Vivaldi: Browser for my personal browsing. I typically have 30 tabs open and loaded. A ton of extensions. * Firefox: I have a separate profile for each client. I usually have two or three each with 10-20 tabs. * WhatsApp: For talking to people. * Discord: For talking to people. * Slack  Teams  Skype: Chatting with the clients. They don't typical use the same chat programs. * GMail  Todoist  Calendar: They are running in separate windows for general productivity management. * ManicTime: To keep track of my tasks for personal tracking and knowing how much to bill the clients. * Microsoft OneNote: Where I keep all my notes. * Microsoft Word: Several instances for different documents I'm working on. * Inspiration: For brainstorming * Adobe Premiere Pro: For creating video tutorials and other contents. * Adobe Photoshop: Usually for Branding. * VMWare: I'm running multiple VMs for different products. Mostly Linux but several Windows 10 ones that eat memory. * Visual Studio Code: Code exploration of different products. * Visual Studio 2020: For different code basis  mainly Visual Basic personal projects. * Android Studio: Some clients have mobile apps. * YouTube Music: Keeping my ears busy. * Balsamiq: For prototyping * Some games still running in the background  usually [BeamNG.drive](https://BeamNG.drive) loaded with a map. * Several things running in the tray. Memory consumers include HWInfo  SIP  and Steam  I'd like to get your opinions and your workflow  it would be very interesting. I know many of you recycle older ThinkPads with 16GB or 32GB. I wonder how much I could personally cope with such little RAM.,negative,2021-12-17
Need help to decide about E15 AMP - dual external monitors?,Hi everyone!

Was considering G3  but I don't need bigger battery since laptop will be used for WFH with occasional travelling where working on the field isn't a thing; 5500U? It has more threads  but even 4th gen i5 was more than enough for all the tasks.   Also  Gen 3 cost around 880€ and can't justify such a price increase for an upgrade I won't notice.  There are Intel models  but they cost 800\~900 and come with 10th gen CPUs. Thuderbolt docks are also more expensive.  I'm planning to add 8GB immediately as well as put another SSD.  My main concern is whether E15 AMD versions can support two external 1080p@60Hz displays? I was looking into this [dock](http://baseusofficial.ie/product/baseus-hub-enjoyment-series-type-c-notebook-adapter-gray-catsx-f0g/) for 70€  it has the exact ports I need - VGA and HDMI  but I heard some people have issues with non-Thunderbolt docks and AMD Thinkpads.

Lenovo T14 Gen 2 Problem with refresh rate,I just got my T14 Gen 2 AMD Ryzen 7 Pro 5850U Today but i got a problem with it. I don't even know if it's normal or not but when i'm moving a window or scrolling some texts on the internet it feels like the refresh rate of pixels is kinda weird. like it's taking time to refresh them properly. I know the display is a 60 hertz and all my other devices at home runs on 144 hertz or 120 hertz for my phone. I thought I was the problem but I tried the same process on my GF laptop (also a 60 hertz display) and it seems it's not that bad. is the product like that or maybe I am the problem ? Thanks In advance.,positive,2021-12-16

Rembrandt in Thinkpad?,Lenovo seems to be warming up quite well to AMD cpus.  I'm sure they would've adopted them into more of their Thinkpad lines had the supply been there  but AMD seems to have been pretty wafer constrained.  All that being said  do you think we'll find AMD's Rembrandt chips in any new lines (say T15  or T15p lines) in 2022?  RDNA2 seems very promising for a mobile chip  and I keep telling myself to wait for it as I think it'd provide the graphics power I'd like while still having impressive battery life.

Using x270 like a desktop  battery dilemma,Hi   I got an X270 that I use for daily driver  pratically like a desktop setup (always with external display). I have two batteries  battery life is decent for an old laptop  but in this way I must to charge at least once a day  probably decreasing the life of the batteries. Should I always keep the laptop on charge?  It's a classic dilemma  I know. I think it is still better to do normal charging cycles until batteries are good  but I can't make up my mind and I would like to ask to Thinkpad experts :)  Thanks.,negative,2021-12-15
Deciding between two X1E4 models,"I'm considering an X1E4  but I'm at a crossroads. I'm pretty set on going i7/3050/WWAN as I don't really use my travel laptop for gaming (and I have a monster rig at home anyways).  Here's my questions:  1. Is there really a need for the i9? Benchmarks show it's a horrible value. 2. Is there a use for a 3070 over a 3050 if I doubt I'll be playing any games? 3. Furthermore  should I consider the integrated Intel graphics to save battery and future proof myself should I want to run Linux? I recall from my T440 that Nvidia was a nightmare in Linux. 4. What am I looking at overall for performance/battery tradeoff between these? If the i9/3070 is a beast and only costs me 30 min in battery  that's fine. But if the i7/Intel gfx will give me an extra 2 hours  it's a no brainer for me. 5. If I do get the i7/3050  can the 3050 be 100% disabled in both Windows and Linux? 6. Last one...can the Intel GPU run an extra 4k display? Would only need one at most.  And a little on my use case...this is a travel machine  and I'm sometimes away for more than a month at a time. I do some pretty extensive desktop work  mainly keeping everything open all the time. While even command line server admin stuff or a VM won't need all that power  I'd rather pay more now than later to upgrade/replace. If I play games on it  it's rare. I've not played a single game on my 2017 MBP it's replacing. I don't know how the cooling is either  but my friend's i9 MBP with some Nvidia chip would just slow to a crawl immediately as it got too hot. Not to mention  it's a bastardized laptop chip  and I have a 5950x/6900XT desktop at home hooked to a 77"" LG OLED when I want to play games.  Cost difference looks to be about $700 premium for the i9/3070 model. I feel it's smarter to bump up warranty  and get WWAN. I don't *need* WWAN but it sure was handy on my T440 when I didn't have wifi. But then again  tethering is pretty fast and robust these days.  Thoughts?",positive,2021-12-17
X230 Tablet has signs of life but wont reliably boot.,Hi /r/thinkpad  I'd like to consider myself tech literate but I'm at a loss with this one. I purchased a used X230 Tablet with the knowledge that it had issues. It came with two batteries  two chargers and two keyboards so I knew the previous owner had tried troubleshooting (yet I still purchased the dang thing).  When the laptop first arrived I powered it on and got to the BIOS! It said the clock was incorrect so I set it correctly exited the BIOS saving and quitting. The laptop would not boot afterwards. I left it overnight and attempted to turn it on this morning where I again got to the BIOS but it died before I could set the time. For whatever reason it seems like leaving the laptop for a period of time will give it some juice before it shuts down and fails to turn on again. I'm 75% sure that when I turned it on the very first time upon receiving it that I heard beeps from the laptop  but since then I haven't heard any. Also worth noting is that I believe one of the batteries it came with is fake. [https://imgur.com/a/3G4OiID](https://imgur.com/a/3G4OiID) The one that doesn't have recessed rubber is the one I believe to be fake  it is incredibly difficult to insert because the slots pictured are smaller. The Lenovo sticker is also a bit more scuffed and fake looking. Below I will list the issues in slightly more depth and also what I have done to troubleshoot.   Issues:  * When I turn the laptop on with the battery installed the Wifi  Battery and Sleep indicators are lit. The battery indicator has both green and orange lit. These indicators stay lit until the battery is removed. No display  no fan  no nothing.  * With the battery uninstalled and the charger inserted the indicators are briefly lit and then go out  the power button does nothing. Removing the charger gives the same result without fail.  What I've tried:  * All the RAM things. Running with one stick  changing slots  no RAM  using known working RAM from my X230. * Stripping down the laptop by removing the keyboard  wrist rest  Wifi  CMOS battery  Bluetooth daughter board and SSD. I read a post here saying that all of these can be removed and the laptop should still boot with some sign of life. * Different chargers. The laptop shipped with two chargers  one was heavily frayed with exposed wires so I immediately binned that one. The other charger it came with is a Lenovo 90w charger. I've also tried the charger I use for my X230 which is a Lenovo 90w charger.   If it wasn't for the few slight signs of life I've seen from this laptop I would say it's a dead system board. I haven't gone beyond the teardown listed above  where I can reach everything I needed to remove by just removing the keyboard and wrist rest. Any help would be greatly appreciated.,positive,2021-12-16
thinkpad x1 carbon 6th gen - keyboard upgrade?,Pretty sure it is a factory defect but my 6th gen x1 carbon  that i bought used  the f1 key rubber membrane part is a little off so it is very sensitive. when i fist got it it would just click itself. i removed the f1 key and tried to nudge the butterfly mech and the membrane to stop it from happening. it doesnt do that now  but if u graze the key  it actuates. the laptop is out of warrenty   but this could be an opportunity to upgrade hte keyboard. i see the newer x1 carbons have this touchbar  and i was trying to see if its possible to swap it with a newer kayboard  but coiuldnt find any good results or at all  so mine as well ask reddit. does anyone know if that is possible? they look nearly the same to me  the only differenc ei can see from pics is the touchbar.,positive,2021-12-15
T470s very slow on battery,Hi fellows thinkpadders   I have a T470s where I recently put a new battery. After doing so  using the laptop without AC is painful. The frequency goes down to 400MHz and the load sometimes is above 10 and the processor doesn't goes up. If I connect the AC then the frequency goes up and it works perfectly.  I've updated the BIOS to the latest version (1.41)  changed there the battery behavior to maximum performance  and even that way I can not get it to work above that. Sometimes it jumps to \~900MHz and sometimes even higher  but it is painful slow to detect the load and goes down really fast.     Maybe that was the reason why it came with only one battery..... The batteries are:   BAT00: SMP 00HW023   BAT01: Sanyo 00HW024     I use Ubuntu 20.04. All I need from this laptop is to keep the performance with the battery instead of keeping the frequency that low that is barely usable.  Other than that this is very good machine to work on.... maybe all I need is a longer AC cord... like 1km long... :D     I'll be grateful with any advice/help.,negative,2021-12-16

Am I Crazy? From P17 Gen 1 to T14 or P14s,Hey everyone   So I currently have a Gen 1 P17 w/ 4k screen  i9-10885H  32GB RAM  1TB SSD (I still have the original drive but I replaced it with dual 1 TB SSDs) and NVIDIA Quadro RTX 3800. I got this laptop about 3 months ago for $2 200.  I love this laptop but what I am don't really like is the the 4k screen and the battery life isn't great. The biggest con is the weight for me.  I want to get a T14 or a P14s (they seem to be the same) with Ryzen 7 Pro 5850U and integrated graphics as I really have no use for a discrete GPU)  16GB RAM  1920 x 1080 - 400 Nit Display. It is coming out to be around 1 200-1250 for this set-up.     Edit: This includes the cost of a new Intel WiFi card; since Linux doesn't play well with Realtek/Broadcom out of the box.   Since I run Linux with a wm (i3wm) NVIDIA GPU has been kind of a pain in the butt lately and Sway + Wayland doesn't offer good support for NVIDIA chips anyway.  I don't think it would be that hard to sell my P17 and recoup some money. Am I crazy for wanting to make this change?,negative,2021-12-15

W541 won't boot,"Hi   I'm trying to piece together the bits required for a W541.

Need something to prop up the nub on the yoga series.,I got an X1 Yoga gen 2 and its been my daily driver  I got it for free as my father's old work laptop   A while ago I was doing a repair to the keyboard (wtf   it took 2 days)  and I ended up taking out the things for the flip out keyboard (Good  I hated the noise it made when it flipped in and flip out)  which also affected something with the nub it seems as the lever for the nub wont come all the way up.  \\\_|\_/   on the inside it looks like that and I need to raise up the lower piece which holds up that lever (what the nub goes on).

If you need a workstation  get a P15 or P17 now  here's why...,They are reducing the P15 and P17 down to one P16 next year. This will be a new design and a first generation. The volume will be smaller  and thermals will most likely suffer unless performance per watt takes a major efficiency boost. Right now it looks like the windows side is continuing to play the higher wattage card at both Intel and Nvidia (as opposed to Apple).  The P17 and the P15 have had YEARS to iron out issues dating back to the P53 models. Then they went onto 2 generations as P15 and P17.  The Ampere series is by far as powerful of a card as you are going to want in a laptop form factor  and if you need more you really do need to take the work over to a desktop.  The current Xeon series are beasts. The 11955 runs impressive benchmarks  and the 3.2GHz base of the 11855 is a note worth runner as well.  I see no reason  or benefit  to wait for the P16 nor do I find it enticing. Not from a function over form stand point anyway.  I also wanted to share some of the major players in fine tuning my P17  where it now is a thermal god:  \- TPFanControl  \- Throttlestop  \- Elevate off desk so bottom air intake is not blocked and has some distance between itself and desk  \- Remove bottom chassis and peel off the paper backing which acts as a sound deadening material  \- Once the paper is removed  also remove the mech material that is just adhered with minor adhesive (not hard to peel back).  You will open up the lungs of the P15 and P17 by doing this. Of course  you can't bring your laptop into the middle of a sandstorm in Iraq anymore (haha?) but who does anyway?  Lastly if you are doing something VERY intensive for hours  I recommend removing the keyboard for that duration with how easy it is to do. This by itself makes a MAJOR drop in thermals. \~10\*C  &amp;#x200B;,positive,2021-12-17
Misadventures of a Yoga X1gen4: Lenovo Repair in Europe SUCKS big time,"Just wanted to report here my recent  sad experience with warranty servicing in Europe (Scandinavia)  apparently taken care of by ""Lenovo Flex"" staff located near Warsaw.  Started almost two months ago. My one-year-old Yoga X1 gen 5 started to power down mid-boot  and the screen wouldn't work. Clearly a hardware problem because it was happened also trying to boot from Linux on USB. Also  the right trackpoint button had often been unresponsive since a week before (again hardware  same problem appeared on USB Linux).  So I sent the laptop for warranty repair – apparently this happens at ""Lenovo Flex"" located near Warsaw. The email exchange to do this was quite OK and relatively smooth (the people on the other end sometimes seemed not to really read what I wrote). Apparently it was the motherboard  which got replaced. After 10 days or so I got my laptop back via DHL.  Sadly I noticed that the right button was often still unresponsive  but – much worse – the screen had several scratches that weren't there before (it had no scratches at all). They could be felt writing with the pen.  Quite disappointed I opened another service ticket  and they organized sending my laptop to Lenovo Flex again. I stressed that the problem were two: scratched screen and right button. This time the servicing took more than two weeks  because apparently they had to wait for a new screen to arrive. Alright  let's wait.  Yesterday I finally received my laptop back. The right button seems to work  and the screen seems new  I see no scratches. But guess what? The upper part of the bezel  near the camera  is now damaged. It looks like someone scratched a screwdriver or similar on it: part of the plastic has been shaved off.  So new service ticket to Lenovo now  with lots of complaints in CAPITAL LETTERS.  Does any of you know if I can ""escalate"" this somehow? Obviously the staff from Lenovo Flex are not professionals. I want my laptop repaired  but surely not from them!  ""Premium"" brand  what a joke!",positive,2021-12-15

It's definitely a  Thunderbolt port as at work (with another monitor) it works flawessly.  If I use HDMI it works so it's not that I don't know how to set it up  correctly. So basicaly it works but one reason why I bought this monitor  was that they advertise that via USB C the monitor kind of works like a  docking station and this feature is of course not working with HDMI.  The power supply via the monitor is just 60w so this is definitely not enough however I thought that I can still use the ports on the monitor.     So fact is that I do not get a picture but after a few freezing screen seconds I get a hint/warning that the connected power supply is not enough. Well  so I was curious if this could even damage the battery and I should not dare to use the Thunderbold connection for that anyhow - although the higher frequency than HDMI.     Btw  via a real docking station in between the connection it is working as expected and the X1 gets charged although it's just 120W (and not 135 as the original power supply). So again  is this a problem  however it is not my docking station but it might be a solution to get rid of the cable chaos.     And  I should mention that  with another computer (HP ZBook Firefly 14 G7) the USB C connection isn't really working either so I was cursious if I should bring the monitor back but then again it worked two times out of many. I hate monitors and printers.     So  I have the proof that it is indeed working  but most times not. So what is going on here  is this a known issue  is it a Windows thing  ... any ideas  it drives me crazy?,negative,2021-12-17
X330 issue with display or pch,Hello   My x230 mod FHD (x330) has issue after i replaced thermal pasted and thermal pad. The machines run around 5 hours then it appear the line in top of screen as image attached. I need to shutdown machine for 1 hour then it can run normally around 2-3 hour then it is showed again.  I replace thermal pasted (**Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut for CPU)** but I mistaken removed also orginal thermal pad on PCU. First I replace thermal pad by thermal paste - no changed  replace with other used fan (FRU 04w0435 from x220) - temp is at 50\*C (good) but no changed on line issue on screen  replace other thermal pad at 1.5mm but no change. Any idea on my issue?  I plan to replace new fan for x230 from AVC but not sure it can fix the issue.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/36pvajjuvd481.jpg?width=1077&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66b84dbb1319793e51ccd6faa622854d36e4d1de,positive,2021-12-16

Intermittent wifi disconnection on P14s (archlinux),"Hello  I've recently received a P14s amd gen2 that I am configuring. I have installed arch linux on it. It's working fine for the most part but I had some issues with the wifi that sometimes just randomly disconnects and connects back again.  That issue seems to be mentionned in a dedicated page for Lenovo's model with Intel AX200 such as the P14s [https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo\_ThinkPad\_T14s\_(AMD)\_Gen\_1](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Lenovo_ThinkPad_T14s_(AMD)_Gen_1). There is says that that the wifi is handled and monitored by iwlwifi and can be configured accordingly. But it seems like it's not the case even thought I've installed linux-firmware      $ lspci -nnk | grep -i net -A 3     02:00.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Realtek Semiconductor Co.  Ltd.

Which Thinkpad can I turn into Virtual Machine Monster?,Hello there everyone!  I’m looking to get myself a Thinkpad that will be a dedicated computer for running virtual machines.   The reason for this is because I’m looking to ramp up my Cybersecurity and Network skills and access my tools across multiple platforms / OSs.   I think the only think I truly care about is processing power (i7  i9 or AMD equivalents) and RAM upgrade ability. (I’d like 32GB RAM with the ability to pack more into it later if I want to).   Aside from that and a big ol’ hard drive  I don’t think I give a shit about anything else. Don’t care about gaming at all  touchscreens  speakers  portability (gonna be on a desk and plugged into an external monitor anyways).   What models would be the most cost effective for my needs without spending extra money on crap that I don’t need? (Like lightweight portability and fancy graphics cards)  Is there anything else I should be considering?   Thanks in advance I look forward to chatting!,neutral,2021-12-17
X1 Yoga Gen 6 touchpad question,Ordered up an X1 Yoga Gen 6 around Cyber Monday  which arrived today (surprisingly fast).   First impressions are pretty positive  but I've noticed that the under-touchpad left button has much less vertical movement at the corner than the rest of the touchpad  and is about 50% responsive to clicks at the corner as well. There is not a similar dead zone on the right side.  Anyone else have this issue? Did I get a unit with a faulty touchpad  or is there something I can do to make this one work better? I'd rather not open up a brand new unit  but I'm not necessarily opposed. Should I RMA this thing  or put in a ticket?   Thanks all.,negative,2021-12-17

P1G4 - Display issues via thunderbolt ports,I have had intermittent display issues  which I blamed on the dock I have been using; it's an old USB-C dock (Kensington SD4600P) so sometimes the display (connected via DP to the dock to my thunderbolt port) would simply not work while the USB devices connected would work fine. Now my display isn't working at all and I've tried both a DP to USB C and a HDMI to USB C cables and neither work.   What are the chances it are the thunderbolt ports on the laptop not working? Or is it a better chance that it's crappy cables? This is my first thunderbolt capable device so I'm new to the quirks of these devices.   Is there way to test whatever may be the issue? Before I go to support or start throwing money at more display cables. Thanks,neutral,2021-12-17

Upgrade T480 NVME slot - maximize storage space,"Hello   I have a T480 running Linux. When I bought it I installed a 4TB Samsung SSD 860 and I boot and use that. I am not using the 128 GB NVMe drive.   I've used up the 4TB and would like to maximize storage by replacing the NVMe drive.  How do I figure out which physical drive I need to swap?

The T480 manual mentions  \+ 2.5 x 0.28"" hard disk  \+ 2.5 x 0.28"" SATA SSD  \+ M.2 SSD  I've been reading various posts and it isn't clear if the M.2 is PCIe or SATA. I'd like to maximize storage (at the expense of speed - thats OK) and I'm happy to get an extra cable or adapter if needed  if I could put 4 TB into the M.2 bay. If not 4 TB  what is the largest I can put in? Any suggestions on make and model?  Thank you.",negative,2021-12-15

Thinkpad x230t - Restorations &amp; Upgrades  destination Hackintosh,Hi I'm an happy 1st hand owner of a Thinkpad x230t (3437CTO) bought in 2013. 🔥   I'm performing some hardware upgrades and restorations on this now already pretty old laptop.. Few day ago i've seen the possibility to turn it in an hackintosh. Since it i'm beggining to accumulate informations about bios modding  wwan cards's whitelist  stuff like that..   It come with the large 9 cell battery pack. today she has lost a lot of his original autonomie. I'm actually considering opening the battery case then replace the cell element by brand new lithium accululator. Does someone already does that here ?  Also  i would like to ask about upgrade to 16GB RAM. Officialy it only support PC3-12800 ..  But it seem it could handle way more.. So should i go with :  * **(A)** \~ *PC3L-17000 (2133Mhz)* * **(B)** \~ *PC3L-14900  (1800Mhz)*  * **(C)** \~ *PC3L-12800  (1600Mhz)*   Thank's you guys for your advices 👌,positive,2021-12-17

Thinkpad vs. Macbook Pro 2021 (M1) for Game development,"Hi there   So I already have a beefy windows desktop PC but I will be away from it for the next 5-6 months and need to buy a laptop that I can use mostly for coding  game development (Unity and own-engine project).  The M1 chip looks really nice since it seems to offer an unbeatable combination of high performance  low power consumption &amp; low heat production. I hate loud computers. I love fast computers.  Unfortunately  I really can't use it since I need a native Windows installation to use e.g. console dev kits but also for testing in general. ***  So why am I posting this in /r/thinkpad ? Right now I feel that buying a Thinkpad would be ""least bad"" choice if I'm not buying a Macbook  but I'd like to feel more enthusiastic about this decision  if possible.  What are some of the *awesome* things about using Thinkpads? How is the noise situation? Which one should I buy for game development? (Budget is ~2500 EUR/USD and I prefer a medium-sized laptop  something like 14"")  I feel really overwhelmed by the super large selection of different models and I'm not sure where to even start.

USB on dock not working properly.

I had similar issues in the past with a different dock (another office) but they went away eventually (although in the meantime I changed the motherboard).  What could be causing these issues?

P1 Gen 4 limiting Intel Turbo Boost,I just got my P1G4 with the i9 11950H cpu and oh boy does this thing run hot. At work today mostly idle (10% cpu usage) this machine was running at 4ghz+ and thermally throttling and it's driving me insane. Ironically in a game my CPU was running cooler than idle on the desktop.  On my previous machine (W540) I could go into Intel Extreme Tuning utility and limit the maximum turbo boost speed  and drop the power limits to get much better battery life/thermals. But on this new machine I can only limit the turbo boost power  the options for CPU speed are greyed out.  Has anyone found a way to unlock these values? I'm not trying to overclock my system  so I'm not sure why Intel would completely lock me out of lowering the clock speeds in XTU.  Are there any better tools that will allow me to limit turbo boost without entirely turning it off?,negative,2021-12-16

T440p BIOS will not update,T440p running bios version 2.24  ec version 1.08. Attempting to update bios to fix suspend issues in Linux. Because I am running linux  I cannot use the standard bios update utility. Instead  I download the ISO and extract a bootable version with geteltorito. I have tried BIOS versions 2.25  2.26  2.36  2.38 and 2.56. The result is the same for all of them. It boots into the utility  goes through all of the warning steps expected there and tells me that I need to reboot and that the update will finish next time the bios boots. Some appear to be updating the ec  but once that is complete  I am back to bios 2.24 and ec 1.08. Any thoughts on what could be causing this?,negative,2021-12-15

Issues with suspend / shutdown -- X1 Carbon Gen 9 (Ubuntu),Hi everyone  just took the plunge and bought an X1 Carbon Gen 9 with Ubuntu pre-installed. I love almost everything about the laptop but have found some issues with suspend/shutdown.   The issues I have are:  1. The laptop does not seem to actually suspend when clicking the power button or selecting from the Power Off/Log Out options on the menu. The screen turns off but the keyboard lights stay on 2. When coming back from suspend  the laptop is sluggish to react (does not respond at all for a few seconds) 3. When I turn off the computer the lights stay on unless I keep the power button pressed (hard-reset)   I'm on the latest version of Ubuntu (21.10).  I'd appreciate any help anyone could give me! Thanks everyone,negative,2021-12-16

T480s vs T495s,Looking for a basic thinkpad to do light work on.   torn between a t480s and a t495s. both have the same ram  ssd  screen price etc. The big differences are the cpu (8350u vs 3500u ) and thunderbolt vs plain usb-c. I know there are other differences like soldered ram situation and rj-45 ports but they dont really impact my decision on this.  On paper the intel cpu has slightly better performance while using less power. AMD didn't really pull ahead until the 4th gen chips.   My main issue with pulling the trigger on the T480s is the issue they all had with the thunderbolt controllers. I'm just worried that in a few years all the 8th gen intel thinkpads stop charging and such.  I keep telling myself that I'm being paranoid and get the intel. I then tell myself that I won't really notice the difference in cpu between the two and to get the amd to be safe.  thoughts ? suggestions ?,positive,2021-12-17
For anyone wondering if there is a fix for the touchpad issue on the X1C9...,"Just got mine back from Lenovo Repair. The issue was touchpad crapping out after coming out of sleep in both windows and linux.  I found out RIGHT AFTER sending in that the issue only exists when setting sleep state to ""Linux only"". I am a Linux user and don't need a new sleep state  so I set it to what I thought was correct. Id prefer the ""Linux only"" sleep state so it would consume less battery when in sleep  but not the biggest deal I guess.  Either way I wanted to see how Lenovo would handle it  since this is an obvious flaw in the product. Was expecting to get it back with no repairs done  but the sleep state set back to ""windows and linux"". They didn't even bother to do that and the issue is clearly still there. No note saying we couldn't fix  nothing.  Looks like they may have replaced the touchpad to a different one (since it seems slightly off square)  but it should have been obvious to them from the start that it would not fix the issue. I'm guessing they still saw the issue after replacing  but knew there was nothing they could really do. They could have at least said its a hardware flaw instead of shipping me it back in the same state. Thank god I was able to figure out a workaround on my own.    To add insult to injury  I had a nice D-brand skin on the top lid that they removed for some reason.  Thanks Lenovo.  Not sure what my next laptop will be  but I can say with almost certainty that it will not be a newer Thinkpad. Lenovo has lost me as a customer.",positive,2021-12-15

Should I replace my E490?,Hello everyone.  I've had a Thinkpad e490 (without dedicated GPU) for a year and a half now. I changed the screen for a Full HD and also use a 1TB NVMe SSD (Samsung 980). Taking advantage of the fact that the screen is having problems (bright pixels) I have been looking with interest at the second generation Thinkpad L14. Should I replace my e490 with the L14 or should I just replace the screen with a spare and wait a few more months or years?

T15g Gen 2 tpfancontrol settings,Sharing my tpfancontrol settings for T15g Gen 2  so far. I've been testing and refining for a few days now. The cooling system seems to be able to handle a lot  so the first step up in fan is not for a while. The OE fan profile is very sensitive and gets annoying at times  as in once you stress the machine  the fans never turn off even though the temps are cool.  In testing  I attempted heat soaking for an hour with Witcher 3 at Ultra FHD  and the unit stayed at a constant 83C  with the fans on level 3 I believe  pretty quiet. This profile also lets the unit stay on the lowest fan setting if it passes the threshold  so it cools down after doing something intensive.  Normal browsing  light productivity work  the fan is on the lowest setting or not at all.  Caveat: I am having issues with the laptop going into standby  and trying to determine if tpfancontrol or my USB-C dock is the culprit. YMMV  &amp;#x200B;  * ProcessPriority=3 (had to up this by one  as the default of 2 was laggy) * Cycle=4 (the default of 5 would randomly put the fans at full blast for a second)  &amp;#x200B;  * Level=52 0 * Level=65 1 * Level=75 2 * Level=85 3 * Level=93 4 * Level=96 5 * Level=99 128,positive,2021-12-17
T14s Gen 2 schematic? Or at least motherboard eDP connector pinout?,I saw in some of the posts in this subreddit that people have shared Lenovo schematics. Does anyone have a T14s Gen 2 schematic?

Let's talk about bodily fluids,As most of us know  the modern Thinkpad coating is specially designed by chemists to absorb every last drop of oil from human skin and display it for the world to see in the form of smudges  smears  dark blotches and other assorted fun patterns that are nigh on impossible to remove short of using acetone to strip the entire coating from the chassis.   So I'm curious what those people unwilling to accept an oily fate are doing to protect their Thinkpads from their bodily fluids. For some models there are commercially-available skins available  but for many models there are not (including one I just ordered -- X1E/P1 gen 4). Has any one found some sort of other vinyl wrap that is think yet protective enough and  more importantly  can be removed at some future date without leaving adhesive residue or damaging the original Thinkpad coating?   All I want to protect is the lid and palm rest  but I imagine the nice curved edges of many Thinkpads might make it difficult to get a precise fit for anyone cutting their own skins without the use of a CNC laser cutter.,negative,2021-12-16

Thinkpad X220 lid closure is not working  not registering in ACPI logs.,This was working previously  it only started happening right after I installed Arch Linux  I was using EndeavourOS and it was working fine though  which is odd. The magnet in the base of the touchpad is present  I have not checked the webcam though  so I may need to do that. The thing is though  I do not know how to solve this because most other solutions for this are documented because the OP lost the base magnet  which is the thing I don't have an issue with.

Help me decide between X1 Carbon Gen 9 and T14s Gen 2...,Trying to pick between [this X1 Carbon Gen 9 for $1 543](https://imgur.com/k83evla) and [this T14s Gen 2 (AMD) for $1 137](https://imgur.com/KuLgy2i). If you don't want to look at the specs  the real differences (aside from $400!) is that the T14s has 32GB RAM and the higher resolution UHD monitor. Is the build quality and form factor of the X1 Carbon significantly better than the T14s where it is worth sacrificing the slightly better specs  better monitor  and $400 to get the X1 Carbon??  Looks like the weight and size are very similar  with the X1 Carbon obviously being smaller and lighter with a slightly larger screen.    I would use the computer mostly for lawyer crap: zoom meetings  emails  drafting documents  simply spreadsheets  working with large PDFs  usually all at the same time with multiple windows and documents open at the same time.

Nano with 4g? X1Cg9 with WWAN-ready  and buy the card? Linux-support,Greetings  Currently rocking a 5th gen X1C  but the battery is starting to fail me.  Work can buy me a new one  but I'm thorn between getting a X1C Gen9  or a X1 Nano.  More info:  - I use Linux exclusively  I might consider distro-hopping  but it has to work at some level - and I have to do the base install - no OEM-ubuntu/fedora-installation from Lenovo.  - I need WWAN  4g is more than enough - 5g is an option (I assume I can still connect to 4g if 5g is unavailable)  - As everyone knows  there's a shortage of things. I can buy a X1 Nano right now  with a 5g-modem (for some reason  that model is cheaper than the exact same option with a 4g-modem..).  OR  I can buy a WWAN-ready X1C Gen9 which shows as available by mid-january.  BUT - I have some questions:  1) According to the sources I have found  there are issues with a WWAN-whitelist - so I can't just buy a random LTE-modem of ebay (or similar) and assume that it will work?  2) How well supported are the WWAN-modems on Linux anyway? I read around and it seems that there's multiple issues due to some FCC-code or requirements or something? All the previous gen's X1C I have work great with WWAN.  3) Or should I look for something else?  I'm mostly happy with my current X1Cg5 - but 3h battery - which sometimes fails to charge isn't something I can work with.  I commute about 30mins each way daily  and the smaller size of the Nano seems tempting  but the lack of USB-A does not.  But some of the sources I have found indicate an issue with WWAN and the Nano also - so I'm not sure about my options here anyway...,neutral,2021-12-15

Severe display glitches on P1 gen 4 / g4,"I have been having trouble capturing a picture of these glitches  but I get vertical bands of black (sometimes on the whole screen). Seems to be exacerbated maybe by web browsers  but it will persist if I close the browser. There's no guaranteed way to make it happen  but screen sharing in Zoom \*usually\* makes it happen.  It's the A2000 on the i7-11800  4K display (it was one of the preconfigured builds).  To get support to even talk to me  they told me I need to upgrade to a more expensive support plan to talk to a level 2 technician (I already paid for the 3-year support plan  and have the 1 year included depot plan). I think that's ridiculous to require me to pay more to fix a broken-on-delivery system  so I'm planning to RMA the machine.  So there are two questions:  1 - should I get another P1 Gen 4? Maybe just with a different chip / GPU? I've seen a number of reports of A2000 glitches  but not with other GPUs. I didn't want the 4k display either... so I can probably ""downgrade"" that.  2 - Does anyone recognize this issue and have a fix? Does it sound like bad hardware on my specific unit that could actually be repaired? I'm wary of going into a cycle of hardware support with no guaranteed way of reproducing the problem  and like I said  no one in support will even talk to me without me paying more money.  The main concern is I need 32+ GB of RAM and ideally lots of cores (I do Kubernetes development of scientific and web applications). In my ideal world  I'd actually get a Ryzen 7 or 9 and a QHD-ish display. But the P1 seemed pretty close to ideal (and I can get a QHD-ish display at least).  I'm also kinda reeling from how bad Lenovo support has been. Is this normal these days?",positive,2021-12-15
T15 gen 2 won't turn on - blinking lights - dead mobo?,After not using my T15 gen 2 for a few weeks I finally tried to turn it back on. I tried plugging in the laptop in case it was a dead battery  but even after a few hours on charge it did not power on. I've tried the 'reset' button on the bottom of the laptop (with and without the battery and CMOS battery connected) to no avail. I've tried removing and re-seating memory  SSDs  etc. No peripherals plugged in.

When I plug in the charger  I get blinking lights (on/off every 1-2 seconds) on the lid (the i)  the power button  and the LED next to the USB C charging plug. It's not the same blinking behaviour as 'sleep' and the T15 remains unresponsive to power button presses.  I can't for the life of me understand what it could be... bad motherboard maybe?

Linux PSA: Solution for high CPU usage with Thinkpad laptop connected to Thinkpad USB-C dock,"In case anyone else out there might benefit:  there is a Thinkpad firmware update (0.1.46 / N34ET46W) that fixes some major issues that Linux users might be experiencing.  Preface:  I've got a brand new Thinkpad Gen2 P15s and matching Thinkpad USB-C dock. (Linux Mint Mate not that it matters.)  Issue seems to be common to a wide variety of Thinkpad models form what I've gathered.   It came directly from China to my front door with old firmware loaded on it - do not assume new hardware has current firmware.  **Symptoms:** I had been suffering for 2 months (since the laptop arrived) from extreme high CPU loads under random situations and a fan stuck in max speed mode.  After much troubleshooting  i noticed it would only happen when connected to my Thinkpad USB-C dock  and recover when i disconnected the dock.  The Thinkpad dock and Thinkpad laptop were an evil and crippling combo.  The always max loud fan did not help.    **Solution:**  (No command-fu required  takes only ~5 minutes.) Install gnome-firmware (needs fwupd) - it's a pleasant firmware updater graphical front end.  Launch ""Firmware"" from your app menu.  Elevate to root when prompted.  In the list  go to ""System Firmware"" to see your Thinkpad bios firmware upgrade/downgrade options.  I previously had 0.1.42 (EVIL) and updated to 0.1.46 (HEAVENLY).  The release notes mention what i suspect is the root cause - a CPU frequency throttling issue.  In hind sight the symptoms exactly match this cause.  Pick the new firmware  start the update process and reboot when prompted.  You'll see some quirky stuff eventually leading to a Lenovo bios firmware update progress bar - let it happen - don't touch.  After a few minutes  system will power down.  Boot and rejoice.  **In my case the difference has been incredible!**  Fan is now whisper quiet  and CPU load under identical activity is now almost always close to zero.  What was a horrible nightmare of a laptop is now a beast!  I hope this helps someone else out there struggling with the same issue!  Get that firmware updated!!",negative,2021-12-16

Is there a lottery about build quality ?,hi  i had a x230  the chassis was made from a cheap plastic and it started to crack after a while. and i sold it. after couple years with a clevo i get myself a T470s. build quality was excellent ! but i had problems with screen and keyboard  it was under warranty lenovo changed them.  then i got myself a x380 Yoga. build quality is shit again. the lid and the body doesnt match  there are some weird flex issues etc. didnt had onsite warranty (and it is expensive to purchase onsite after you buy the device) so i let it rust.  now i want to get myself another thinkpad but i want to be sure about build quality.   how can i be sure of build quality ? i checked psref but as far as i see some models has different materials depending on the region.  i am not in the US so unless there is a technical problem i cant return the device i bought and they are expensive as fuck.  &amp;#x200B;  i want to get a X13 Gen 2 with amd processor. can i expect it to be like t470s ? or i shouldnt bother with this confusion and just get myself a macbook ?,negative,2021-12-17

Is there any way to know if a laptop has a whitelist or if it simply does not have PCI-E hooked up to the M.2 slot?,I have a Lenovo tablet that i was wondering if i could add an M.2 SSD to  to replace the slow eMMC.    I know one of my previous laptops Type 20FY had an M.2 slot that would take LTE modules along with SATA SSD.   But i was never able to find out if it had a whitelist on the slot  or if the M.2 slot just didn't offer PCI-E.    Does anybody here have a way to find out if a slot even offers PCI-E in the first place?   Are there any particular PCI-E devices that are whitelisted i could try out?  I was thinking of dumping the BIOS to find out if it had a whitelist  but none of my programmers seem to be able to read the EEPROM on the board.    The model is Type 20L3.,positive,2021-12-15

Future replacement for a X230 with a bigger screen  that is upgradable but lighter... mission impossible?,"I'm still quite happy with my X230  but I'm considering getting an upgrade next year or so (preferably buying a 2-4 years old second hand thinkpad).  The thing I like least about the X230 is the screen size... 12.5"" is too small  I'd rather have a 13.3"" or 14"" screen.  I'd also like to keep the weight down (under 1.3Kg would be great)  while maintaining some upgradability (replaceable RAM). Is this even possible with a Thinkpad?  T480 or T480s seem like good options  but T480 is a tad bit too heavy (1.6Kg). T480s is lighter  but has 1 soldered RAM and only 1 slot for future upgrades.  Same goes for X390/X395 and soldered RAM...  This seems to be the trend with newer Thinkpads... lighter ones have solder RAM... like if that's what's making them heavy... (I don't buy it  LG Gram 14"" from 2018 has 2 replaceable RAM slots and it weights only 1kg  so it's not impossible to make very light laptops with replaceable RAM).  Other thing is a must have for me is linux support and specifically tlp support and the ability to set charging thresholds.  Built-in ethernet port is very much preferred as well as is a non-reflective screen.  Am I looking for a unicorn? Or such Thinkpad exists?",positive,2021-12-17
A power locked T500,Hello all    I was going through a stack of T500 and T400 that were going to be dumped  and I came across one that on power up wants a password immediately.  I tried the take out the battery  take out the bios battery  hold power on button  leave unplugged for weeks etc  and upon power on there is still the power on lock icon.  Now  rather than replace the entire motherbord  or try to replace the chip  I was thinking reprogram it using one of those USB dongles and the clips.  But this is where I have hit a snag  despite looking around  most mention using a beagleboard and so forth  rather than one of the the little CH341A usb programmers.  I was hoping that perhaps someone here can point me in the right direction for this T500 (Type 2055-45U).  Thank you all.,neutral,2021-12-15

Thinkpad for video streaming recommendations,I recently got a ton of help on here on my x300 (thank you)  and decided to replace it while I tinker with getting it working.  I run a business where I run sports tournaments   and occasionally live stream.  It's like to purchase a thinkpad that meets my needs (which aren't high) but man   there are a lot of options.  It would be to stream live video from a capture device   while also using an external monitor as a scoreboard  so I'm down to an I7 processor with 8 GB of ram and windows OS  but it's all the other options that I'm getting stuck on.  I need an internet port   a USB 3.0 (which I assume most everything has) and external monitor port (lightning bolt  hdmi  or VGA). I will almost always be plugged in to power.   I'm kind of looking at the t460 or t470  but I'm not sure if there is enough of a difference to be worth going up in price point (they aren't super pricey  but I'll likely buy a few)  or if the S versions of these would fit my needs as far as ports   and whether they would be worth looking at.   My main computer is a p50  which I love   the others are mostly t430. Kind of looking fit something in between.     Any help appreciated.,negative,2021-12-16
Old Green Thinkpad,Heya all. Anyone know about the Lenovo Thinkpad from back in the 2010's (I believe)? It was green on the back  and it was a thinkpad. I searched it up and I believe it was the Lenovo Thinkpad Edge 11. 3 years ago I found it in my garage  which my sister got when she graduated and she used it for school. Unfortunately whenever I tried to download a app it got an error (I think the school implemented it)  and back then I didn't know how to make a bootable USB. It was running on Windows 7  and it had the old black and blue iTunes. Anyway  when we moved we put it somewhere in our garage so I'm currently looking for it.

X1C9 i5 FHD 4h battery? hot and loud,Hey hey   I waited 2 months now for my X1 Carbon 9th Gen  an almost 2000$ machine in my country. ordered it with lowest i5-1135G cpu  32GB RAM  FHD (Touch) model.  I owned like 200 thinkpads so far (no joke). Alot with and without touchscreen. most models had a negative impact of like 1-2hours batterylife. So I don't think it's the only reason here... I heard that tiger-lake got worse on battery than previous gens but every tester is saying that the FHD model is getting like 13 5hours! leading alot of ultrabook charts. Lenovos declarations vary from 17-26hours! I'm getting 3-5hours MAXIMUM on half brightness (400nits touchscreen measures at 318nits btw) on 480p youtube or just browsing. just typing in the editor is the only thin I get near 9 hours.  It's a new machines  battery wear is zero. battery saving mode activated  CPU has nothing to do. all drivers and updates installed (win10).  are the 32GB soldered RAM sucking that much? can't imagine. Also the machine is unuseable on the lap or chest while lying on couch. Where the fans take in air it's burning hot  I can't touch it without burning myself..   Fans kicking in on an old game like kingdom two crowns (even my T430 can run it without fans running) and when I activate the battery saving mode the little game is stuttering like hell? My T430 can play it with battery-mode enabled no problem? Even writing this text in battery-saver the text is stuttering :o and the upsliding taskbar  flat trackpoint buttons.. they don't click very responsively  keyboard.. kind of mushy and no accurate pressing point. X1 Carbon 6th gen so much better.  My 5th Gen X1 Carbon had triple the batterylife without lowpower screen. X1 Carbon 6th with touchscreen had at least double the batterylife. T430 has 2-3times battery..  speed: everything seems slow. it's kinda fast but my T440p was faster.. in general web browsing  opening stuff etc.  in cinebench after some runs it doesn't want to get above 15W consumption anymore even while temps are ok. and then not above 10watts. Even the first run isn't much faster than my T440p was.  webcam: omg 720p :D  trackpad: hm somehow I liked T440p trackpad alot more (trackpad-mod has to be done ofc)  I even prefer my girlfriends mac over this. 4times battery  blazing fast  keyboard not much of a difference  trackpad alot better  fanless &amp; cool  half the price,negative,2021-12-15

Replaced screen on T480 without taking out batteries  now no screens work,I just tried to replace my broken screen on my T480 with an N140HCG-GQ2  booted it  nothing showed up. Not even the boot splash screen. I double checked to see that the cable was plugged in all the way  and it was. I thought that maybe something was wrong with the new screen  so I put back the old screen and tried it  and now _that_ one didn't work either.  Then I thought for a few moments  and realized that I had forgotten to 1. take out the external battery and 2. disable the internal battery from BIOS. Previously I've swapped screens successfully on this laptop after doing those two steps  so I'm pretty sure that might be a reason that the screens aren't working right now.

4K Scaling Issues on Thinkpad USB C Universal Dock,Hi Folks   I'm having an issue with my ThinkPad USB C Universal Dock not scaling to 4K (40AY0090UK) when in use. My current setup is that I have two 4k screens  connected to a KVM switch with HDMI. This KVM switch then connects to the docking station with two HDMI cables  one of which is converted to DisplayPort to ensure compatibility in this configuration. My issue is that the screens do work when connected to the docking station but will not scale beyond FHD (1920 x 1080).   I have tried connecting to the screens from the KVM switch directly and that scales to 4K as desired but when going through the dock  I can't get it any higher.   I have updated the firmware to the latest release on the dock  updated all drivers for the laptops where possible but I still have this issue.   I found a page on the Lenovo website which suggested that two 4k screens was compatible in this configuration but in classic fashion  I cannot find that page now. According to the support page for this dock  two screens at 3840x2160 screens at 60hz is supported.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/9ust1vlres381.png?width=603&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4273440224407586ac6b7e4863d6c987fd3c13c  Any ideas on where to go from here?  &amp;#x200B;  Devices Tested -   * Lenovo ThinkPad L15 Gen 2  11th Gen i7  Intel Iris Xe * Dell Latitude 5520  11th Gen i5  Intel Iris Xe  &amp;#x200B;  4K Switch - [DEPZOL 4 Port KVM Switch HDMI Dual Monitor 4K 60Hz  KVM Switch for 2 Computers 2 Monitors with USB 2.0 HUB and Cables 942HUA-2 : AmazonSmile: Computers &amp; Accessories](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08MKR1KMK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1)  Monitors -  [ASUS VP28UQGL  28 Inch 4K (3840x2160) Gaming monitor  1 ms  DP  HDMI  FreeSync  Ergonomic Design  Low Blue Light  Flicker Free  TUV Certified  Black : AmazonSmile: Computers &amp; Accessories](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07TZSSYWL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1),neutral,2021-12-15

X1 Carbon 5th gen - shuts off without battery warning,Just curious if anyone has seen this happen with an X1 Carbon before.  I was using the laptop for some work the other day and in the middle of working it just shut off. There was no battery warning  and it would not turn back on until I plugged it into AC  at which point it showed 0% battery charge.  After charging up  it worked again as before. I am just a bit gun shy now of whether this is going to happen again at a time when I depend on it. This was the first time it ever happened.  My initial thought was that it sounds like that situation with an aging battery where the minimum voltage required to operate can't be sustained and the device just shuts off on account of that.  The laptop is about 4.5 years old  so I'm willing to accept that as a diagnosis (and I have procured a replacement battery)  but I have just never seen this immediate shutoff with a Thinkpad before  even with an aging battery.  In terms of cycles  they are quite low - it is plugged in a lot of the time - but I know that battery aging happens somewhat independently of charging cycles  and also that sustaining a charging at 100% on a regular basis can be hard on a battery. I admittedly have probably done the latter more than I should.  Any thoughts/experience appreciated. Thanks.,positive,2021-12-17

Buying my first Thinkpad for tinkering and Coreboot/Libreboot,Hi everyone     I'm looking to buy my first Thinkpad to tinker with. Something classic that I can Coreboot (or Libreboot)  upgrade the screen  upgrade the RAM and even the CPU  if possible. I will obviously be running Linux on it  so performance isn't too much of a concern  but I want it to be usable for web browsing  hobby programming in C and note taking. Would be nice if it was under 120 EUR so that I have some money left over for upgrades.    Coreboot must not require any binary blobs to be installed  since I want to use the notebook later and I'm pretty privacy conscious :)  I really am a sucker for the X series  but I don't know if it's as upgradeable as the T series.    Models I've found locally and am looking at so far:   - T400  CPU Intel c2d P8600  RAM 2GB  SSD 240GB  PSU  new battery  90 EUR - X60  75EUR (AFAIK no Coreboot for this one  but Libreboot seems to work on it)   - X200  CPU Intel c2d L9600  RAM 4GB  HDD 320GB  with docking station  PSU  115 EUR   - X200T  CPU Intel c2d L9300. RAM 4GB  HDD 200GB  stylus  PSU  115 EUR   - + anything else you suggest :)  If you need any additional info  ask away!   Thanks.,neutral,2021-12-15

Upgrade from T450s (i7-5600u ) to T470 (i7-7600u) - worth it?,Hello   currently I have a T450s with an i7-5600u and 20 GB RAM. I am thinking of upgrading to a T470 with an i7-7600u and 32 GB RAM. I mostly use my laptop for work  which means heavy office multitasking on Linux with 7+ workspaces / multiple programs/browsers constantly open and Windows in a virtual machine for Powerpoint.  **Is the difference between the i7-5600u and i7-7600u somehow noticeable / worth it?**  I already tried an T460p which is great with the 8 thread i7 but its too big and bulky for me. Just doesn't feel right.  I am also bound to the docking port because of having to use it in the office  so anything past T470 is off the table.,neutral,2021-12-17

X230 hard drive swap/reshell  is it this simple?,Morning ya legends   My X230 has stopped charging unless the plug is at a very specific angle that takes hours to find.

I know it's super easy to swap them on the X230  but can I just swap them over and boot up the new machine and it'll be like booting up my existing one? Windows etc will be intact and work? Is there anything else I'll need to do? I know I will need to set up the mSATA again  no issue.   Anything else I need to consider  please let me know. Thanks!,neutral,2021-12-15

Best sound via 3.5 jack in headphones? w550s great  t480s s*cks.,"I've used my Thinkpad w550s for long time now. It has i7-5500U with only 2 cores. This year I decided to procure something more recent and powerful and had finally chosen t480s (used) for the low weight  upgradable RAM  Ethernet jack  Thunderbolt and first (hence cheapest) T with 4 cores. At home I use external monitor often so smaller screen might be Ok. But sound... I just listened to same song (at 100% loudness) with my old buddy Sennheiser HD515 and sound is so less loud  less bass  ""flat""... I'm using Linux btw on both (same distro).  What are some modern thinkpads that output great sound via 3.5?  P.S. I've read [https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/ahbfkf/thinkpad\_with\_good\_speakers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/ahbfkf/thinkpad_with_good_speakers/) but it is about speakers  for great speakers laptop is just too small  but for decent 3.5 output I know it is not as w550s is fine  IMO its sound is on par (even slightly louder output) with my LG v20 which was considered by many (AFAIK) as best phone for music at the time when it was new.  And please do not advice separate DAC as see above I'm looking for a laptop that has it all in a box  no dongles.  Thanks for help!",positive,2021-12-16

T14 AMD vs MacBook Air M1 Base model. Don’t kill me  hear me out.,I am not looking to future proof  I am not looking for a 10 year Laptop.

Loving my little ThinkPad L380 Yoga,"You ThinkPadders will be proud of me. After weeks of research last summer I managed to find a 2018 Aluminium ThinkPad Yoga L380  AFAIK the last Yoga to support up to 32 GB of RAM (SODIMM)  an 8th Gen i5 (Quad core 8 threads) 256B nVME SSD with 2 years of depot support left for 750$CAD. Some business owner had bought it for his wife and she didn't want it. I've had a few T series  X series ThinkPads  a XEON Zbook  a XEON Precision  Surface Laptop  Latitude 2 in 1  Latitude 7 series laptop  a 2008 MacBook Pro that served me for 8 years... This light  compact and very capable ThinkPad Yoga is my favorite laptop that I have ever used. Perfect keyboard  ridiculously fast SSD  decent sound  love the IO  it outputs to 2 4K monitors without missing a beat. I've looked at all the current offering of X1 Yogas  there is no possible way to get this kind of performance and delight in such a cozy lightweight little package. I don't know if I'll ever need 32GB of RAM  maybe in 4 years when Windows 10 support ends. I gotta say  this was one delightful find and I hope to keep it until the heat death of the universe. Cons: - cameras are garbo. privacy slider would have been a nice touch. - onboard ""beamforming mic array"" is an echoey mess. &gt;&gt; I just clip on a 4K webcam I got on AliExpress for a few bux and honestly this is the way to do it. Don't bother trying to find a laptop with a ""good"" videoconferencing camera  it's not going to beat the aperture  white balancing  contrast and brightness of a 40$ SJCam. - the friction coefficient of the fiberglass reinforced plastic top case leaves much to be desired. The paint is holding up just fine  but there's no beating the joy of resting your palms on that beautifully textured ThinkPad black polycarbonate plastic.  &gt;&gt; after a year of seeing how I feel about it I decided I will hunt down a black top case and swap it out. Smooth silver on the outside and a slightly darker black on the inside. - why are all laptops so damn edgy at the wrist facing edge of the top case?! It's fatiguing! Every laptop since the 2007 MacBook Pro went from smooth curved top case to ""cutting edge wrist torturizer"". I don't think there's much I can do about that. Microsoft took a crack at it with their alcantara top case but the hard edges are even more uncomfortable on the wrists than plastic. Alas.",positive,2021-12-15
Bought a refurbished/like-new motherboard for my T440p without thinking to ask the seller if the BIOS was locked on it (I plan to flash Coreboot). If it is  would I be able fix it by just swapping out the unlocked BIOS chips from the old board and soldering on the new ones?,And are the BIOS settings even stored on the chips themselves  or on the hard drive  or on the CPU (which I'm going to upgrade at the same time as replacing the motherboard)?  The old board has a blown screen backlight fuse and a non-functional USB port  but I believe most of the parts are still salvageable  so I plan to keep it for spare parts. Also  I still have never actually soldered/de-soldered anything myself  so maybe it can be a learning opportunity if I need to do it.  What's your advice?,neutral,2021-12-15

P14s (gen 1) - USB ports not working,Hi all   Over the past few days I noticed the USB-A and bottom USB-C port (the one for the dock) on the left had stopped working in Windows 10. I believe Windows decided to update some of my drivers and somehow broke some of my USB ports. The weird thing is if I plug the AC adapter into the problematic dock USB-C port  the USB-A port suddenly works and stops working immediately as soon as I unplug the AC adapter.  If I open up device manager I can see that sometimes I get a code 43 for the AMD USB 3.10 eXtensible Host Controller. However  there does not seem to be any correlation between this and my ports not working because the error code doesn't always show up  yet the USB ports in question will still not work.  https://preview.redd.it/x627f5xlqf381.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bde5f72fc80a27c5937c5cf9ebddc13f3ceb4d8f  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/6uyg1qepqf381.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2e421f3f56955eff0797964217f443f5d675ff2  The thing I don't quite understand is that I've also noticed my POST times are now much longer than before.

P51 Quirky Left Click,So  about a month or so ago   I began to notice this issue that I likely overlooked being dominantly a touchpad/trackpad user. My P51 has a  temperamental bottom left click. I've seen this before  on many a laptop I've serviced. It likes to double select things when depressed. Indicative that the previous owner probably wasn't as sensible with clicking as one should be. It likely was depressed excessively hard in its life. TrackPoint related Left/Right click work just fine and the trackpad is in perfect working order.  Being that I use the trackpad under most circumstances  of COURSE this is now an issue that I probably will never be able to ignore. Normally I would take to eBay and grab a replacement component but my issue is that I cannot for the life of me find one. Is this one of those laptops where  the trackpad/left/right click assembly is built INTO the bezel? If anyone has a part number I can refer to in regards to obtaining a replacement  I'd be much obliged.   &amp;#x200B;  Take care.,positive,2021-12-17

T480s Upgrade | Mylar Trackpad Replaced with X1YG3 Glass Trackpad,"Firstly  I would like to thank u/nombre44 for his amazing guide into getting the glass trackpad to work.   His guide can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/jlbj1e/t480\_trackpad\_replacement\_guide\_windows\_driver/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/jlbj1e/t480_trackpad_replacement_guide_windows_driver/)  I've had the T480s for about 2 years  getting me through the last leg of undergrad and Officer Training School and it's still working like brand new. Like many of yall  the Thinkpad name has a lot of sentimental value to me. My first laptop was an IBM Thinkpad R60.   I personally did not mind the mylar trackpad  but after using the glass trackpad on a Dell XPS 15 (9510)  I felt my Thinkpad could use a well-deserved upgrade.   I purchased an X1 Yoga 3rd gen trackpad (FRU 01LV0556) from Lenovo. I'm sure you can find similar parts cheaper elsewhere  but I wanted to play safe: [https://lenovo.encompass.com/item/11587322/Lenovo/01LV556/](https://lenovo.encompass.com/item/11587322/Lenovo/01LV556/)  The installation process was hassle-free. If you are unsure  iFixit has a guide online on replacing the trackpad.   &amp;#x200B;  [The X1 Yoga glass trackpad compared to the Mylar trackpad that's in the laptop](https://preview.redd.it/7p74kqdwqe381.jpg?width=1310&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=050a6fab0d6896a2788fcea45cddc0a03c5c93fe)  Now the fun part starts...  If your laptop has the vPro variant (in my case I have the i5 8350u instead of 8250u)  then you will need to find your BitLocker recovery key. I was able to find mine by logging into my Microsoft account. This will be needed to access the advanced start up setting to disable driver signature enforcement.   Before you follow the guide  I recommend that you either uninstall or rollback the ELAN driver in device manager under *mice and other pointing devices*. After a reboot  your touchpad should be something like ""PS2..."".   For T480s owners  I used the same FRU on step 6. There was only one line that needed to be changed.   https://preview.redd.it/yauoxk57pe381.png?width=822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c64fa0154fe4fe8d85270eca12a21361238dc8  So  was it worth going through all this trouble?  The glass trackpad is definitely much smoother and nicer feeling. It makes the T480s much more enjoyable to use. Let me know how it went for y'all.",negative,2021-12-17

Is there a successor? Now that the decline and fall of the IBM Thinkpad is complete  it's death is final  what do we move to now?,###Lenovo: You blew it up! Ah  damn you! God damn you all to hell!  It's clear that the old days are gone - the Thinkpad has fallen fully from its status as a modular  rugged  repairable  professional  no-compromise machine to a fully compromised machine with macbook-clone thinness prioritized above all else  function be damned. Glue  soldering  increasingly bad and shallow keyboards ruining even the trackpoint  on that note the death of the 7-row keyboard  the removal of indicator lights and physical buttons  the death of the ultrabay  the death of swappable batteries  the introduction of dongles and external chargers  the death of the thinklight  the increasing loss of I/O...   Is it our fate to continually rely on hardware modding work on these ancient chassis trying to keep up? Or are we all simply left behind  relics of an age when computers were functional  doomed to use Macbook Air clones with no ports and wireless charging only and Windows 11 written to ROM and soldered to the board with no local storage  all programs and storage happening in *the cloud*? Old Thinkpads - before its decline had gained momentum - are usable for the time being but what will we do in 10 years? 20?

Diagnosing origin of weird audio glitches,Recently I started getting weird buggy audio. At first I noticed it watching a YT video  and figured it could be a network thing since I was using my hotspot at the time. Then recently it started happening while watching movies off of my external HD  then while playing a number of different games. I know the first time I heard this was quite a while ago  but it was incredibly infrequent and I just dismissed it as some sort of streaming issue. Now within the last few days it is damn near nonstop. I had to turn off the movie I was watching last night because it was happening every few seconds and was absolutely infuriating.  Its kind of hard to describe but its like an odd robotic sounding \*rrrt\* stutter of the audio. Sometimes barely noticeable  and other times it is very obvious.   I've tried going through and disabling/updating the audio driver to no avail and just this morning I decided to throw in my old Linux boot usb to see if this issue would carry over. It did not.   So I know its a Windows problem of some kind. Now since I got this TP I've been telling myself that as soon as I started having issues with the Win10 that it came with I would just switch back to Linux and not deal with the hassle. Problem with that being that I would be dual booting to still use windows for a number of games. So I need to figure this problem out sooner or later  Any ideas on where to start  or anyone actually know what kind of audio bug I'm talking about?,neutral,2021-12-16

PSA: Wayback Machine as a way of retrieving old drivers,I just wanted to share that I decided to put a recovery image of Windows 7 on my T60 and had a bunch of drivers I needed to download.  Not only that but Windows Update refused to function and even activating Windows wasn't working.  In the past I'd always gone to the Lenovo EOL downloads and been able to access whatever I needed  even for older machines.  Now for some reason - at least for the T60 and T60p - none of the files would download.  They appear to have been removed.  On a whim I decided to plug one of the driver download URLs from the EOL portal into the Wayback Machine and lo and behold that amazing thing had actually archived the driver files!  All the ones I tried were there.  The retrieval was slow since they were obviously being pulled from slow storage but I was able to install everything I needed.  On the Windows 7 front I was pretty screwed  since WU was broken and all the links to the big quai-SP update roll-up that I needed to install were either removed by MS or dead.  Again  using the Wayback Machine I was able to retrieve the Servicing Update and update roll-up and after running those everything in W7 that was broken worked.  So if you're working on an old machine and can't locate the drivers you need or some OS update  give the Wayback Machine a try.,neutral,2021-12-16

Swapping Panel of E14 G3 (AMD) to 100% sRGB Version,Hi   I recently bought a ThinkPad E14 G3 (AMD) and really like it so far (man that keyboard!). The only thing that is bugging me more and more is the color accuracy of the display. As I live in Europe  there was no option to buy the device with the optional 100% sRGB panel.

Questions About T420 Upgrades,Hey  so I own a T420 with an upgraded 9 cell battery that seems to average about 1.5 hours at most. Are there any other options for squeezing more battery life out of this laptop? I run Debian 11 XFCE and am using TLP to try and conserve the battery life to the best of my ability.  Granted  it is an old laptop. I love it but if possible it'd be awesome if there were options to get the battery life up to modern speeds.

In Praise of the Trackpoint - A Disabled Person's View,Hey all. I won't bore you with my life's story but long story short  I'm disabled. When you fuck up your shoulder  go see a doctor about it.  I just had shoulder reconstruction. Moving my arm any degrees really hurts and it feels like a stabbing soreness. So no mouse  no trackball  no bouncing back and forth between a touchpad and keyboard either.  The trackpoint is perfect for such a weird event. I am in a sling and yet still able to do my work and keep up with friends without needing to hurt myself like I would if I were to use another laptop.  Thank you Lenovo for not removing it.

IMPORTANT: Thinkpads x12 detachables are not Linux capable and are not given Linux support like other thinkpads are.,I’ve noticed several posts popping up from time to time about Linux issues on the x12 and in fact on ideapads and other devices that use the same processor and audio tech. The x12 IS NOT CONSIDERED a “Linux” capable device by LENOVO itself.  It’s own reps in a forum post below have said as such. The x12 is in reality not really a Thinkpad as far as Linux certification is involved which Thinkpads in general have.  The thinkpad label on the x12 is pure marketing. It is not Linux certified and as of a year of being on sale will probably never be.  Here’s a forum post about Debian and fedora usage on the x12 that I found that details what I just said. Here’s the thing. Despite thinkpads apparently being “Linux capable” out of the box  the Thinkpad x12 is **not** Linux certified. In fact several Thinkpads and ideapads that use the same processor are having the same issues regarding audio usage according to the alsa GitHub page. In reality  the x12 isn’t a real “Thinkpad” and Lenovo apparently doesn’t consider the hassle of helping out x12 Linux users out worth it. I myself occasionally go and attempt to use Linux on my x12 from time to time. It is not worth it. You loose audio support  camera support and trackpoint support. You also loose android app support which is available in windows 11. I’ve made an issue on the alsa page which led nowhere  I asked the Lenovo reps themselves and hit a wall. I’m posting this to save anyone the hassle of installing any kind of Linux distro. Everything from Debian to fedora lacks everything that makes an x12 worth it from tablet support to the basics of audio support. **Unless you want a stripped down bullshit experience and end up with half a computer stay on windows.**    https://forums.lenovo.com/topic/findpost/2734/5070490/5494527,positive,2021-12-17

I am inclined to buy the precision pen pro because of the ""cylinder plus flat side"" profile and the overall properties. But I am not certain if my Thinkpad supports it (it does have Bluetooth  but I cannot find any information on Wacom AES 1.0 or 2.0) or whether it would work at all. The telephone support could not answer the question definitively  the internet has not provided a satisfying answer either. My questions thus: does anyone have **hands-on experience** with the mentioned pen(s)? Do they work (fully/with **restrictions**/not at all)? How do they **feel** (too slippery/like paper)? I'd prefer not to buy  try out and send back every single one and there is not designated hardware support where I could try them out near me. Or maybe you have an entirely different recommendation?

T495 randomly not charging/dock not working,A few days ago my ThinkPad T495 suddenly disconnected from the dock  the charging light and power light were blinking like the dock is disconnected and connected again at a very fast speed (there also were some weird ticking noises). As I've later noticed the same happens when I'm connecting a charger.  Things I've tried: - Using the other USB-C Port - Using the hole to temporarily disconnect the battery and then pressing the power button for 30 seconds - Disconnecting the battery and even CMOS then pressing the power button for 30 seond and finally reconnect the battery and CMOS - Removing the battery completely and powering the laptop by the dock  The last three things all helped  but only temporarily (for a random amount of time  sometimes it worked for a day  sometimes for half a minute)     Any ideas what I could try next?,positive,2021-12-16
Are the X260 and X270 Thinkpads still running hot and have erratic fans  or has this been fixed?,I‘m thinking of getting one of those  but I found a bunch of old posts of people complaining  that they‘re getting really hot and the fans start spinning when they’re just watching youtube or browsing. The last posts I found about this issue are several years old and claim that Lenovo planned to fix this with a BIOS update… now I‘m wondering if this ever happened. I‘d like to use it for university  so it definitely needs to be quiet. I‘d mostly use Office  nothing too demanding.. maybe have Discord open in the background or watch Netflix during breaks. I plan on running a light-weight-ish Linux Distro on it  in case that‘s important.   I found a good deal for the X270 i5-7300U with 8GB RAM but the fan issue would be a dealbreaker for me.

Screen protector/minor pen issue for X1 yoga gen 6,Hi all  just got a new Thinkpad x1 yoga gen 6  pretty happy with it overall so far.  I intend to use it as a tablet for taking notes during lectures and I am looking for a screen protector that doesn't interfere with touch and pen input. The only issue I am having is that the gen 6 seems new enough that I can't seem to find one tailored to it  and the fact that they decided to switch to a 16:10 screen means I don't think those designed for older versions will fit right. Any recommendations?  As a side note  has anyone else experienced issues with the Lenovo pen settings app? The pen seems to work correctly  but the settings app seems to have no idea what the remaining battery is and often refuses to update. Setting it to display the pen battery in the task bar also seems to randomly stop working and there will be no pen battery displayed there. Is there an alternative software that works better (perhaps directly from Wacom)? Or should I just resign myself to never knowing what the remaining battery on the pen is? Should I just pick up an Active Pen 2 (or a 3rd party stylus)?  Thanks for your time :),neutral,2021-12-16

Used T490s  i7-8665U 32GB RAM or new T14s Gen 2  i5-1145G7 16Gb RAM?,I found what seems like a great deal on a new T14s Gen 2 ([https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/r7cgrw/t14s\_gen\_2\_i51145g7\_16gb\_ram\_deal\_with\_stackable/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/r7cgrw/t14s_gen_2_i51145g7_16gb_ram_deal_with_stackable/)).  Before finding that  I was seriously considering a used T490s with i7-8665U. It's roughly $200 cheaper  when everything is taken into account. Same screen  same SSD  the used one has slightly less than 2 years warranty remaining  the new one 3 years  The only real difference is the processor  faster and better overall for the T14s  with faster  LPDDR4X 4266MHz RAM compared to  DDR4-2400  plus according to everything I read  the Iris Xe graphics should be significantly better. And the RAM; the used one comes with 32Gb and the T14s with 16Gb. For what is worth  currently using a T440s with 8Gb  and doesn't seem to be a huge limiter (even if Chrome does its best to eat it all)  I will run Windows 11  mostly light tasks (office work  the occasional hobby embedded development project  simple photo or video editing  which will require an external monitor anyway given the low gamut of the FHD Lenovo screen). Maybe some SDR application every now and then. No gaming at all  nor video encoding projects  My sense is that the T14s will run quieter  will have better battery life (if nothing else because it's a new battery  vs 2 years old one). And for the occasional times when I will push the laptop  the i7 throttling will probably have a bigger impact than the extra 16GB or RAM will. So the extra $200 are justified  Am I missing something where 32Gb of RAM will make a really big difference in everyday use?,negative,2021-12-17

I added a  USB 3.0 Ethernet adapter ($24.99)  and basically that was free. My final price before taxes is $951.26. The USB Ethernet adapter ends up costing only $4... Any accessory around $20 will be basically free  Also  unlike many deals I saw for Black Friday/Cyber week  the laptop ships in a couple of days  not 2+ months  Now for the not so good parts:  * It's the new ""Storm Grey"" chassis  which is almost a half pound heavier than the black one  and probably not as rigid (from 2.99 lbs  1.36kg to 3.46 lbs  1.57kg for the touchscreen version) * The screen is only 300 nits  45% NTSC  so not the best (but ok for my use  and very similar to the one I already have) * The IR camera is only 720p  but I have using video in conf calls  so almost a plus :)  All in all  a very solid deal.

ACPI Sensors P17 ThinkPad,I have a sensor or two that is listed under ACPI in HW info that likes to hang out in high 50's low 60's when I have my (2) 4K Dell displays hooked up. My CPU will be high 40's low 50's when watching youtube however those 2 ACPI sensors will creep up as I mentioned. Nothing crazy but will get into 60's with what I would consider lighter work. I do feel it is due to the external displays. it is not the dGPU as that will be high 40's when these ACPI sensors are high 50's low 60's.  Ideas on what sesor this could be? motherboard sesor? And are these temps an issue?   When I am using the P17 alone not hooked up to a display those ACPI sensors drop down into high 40's.,negative,2021-12-15

[Linux] Slight problem with the Trackpoint on T420s with Linux Mint,This problem is more of a minor inconvenience/annoyance but I would love to find a way to fix it. I have two Thinkpads  a T60 running Arch32  and a T420s running Mint 20.2 Cinnamon. The Trackpoint moves the mouse perfectly fine on the screen for the T60  but on the T420s  it feels laggy as if the DPI is somehow lower than the trackpad. Is this something that's happened to anyone else?

Jump Start Battery X1C6,"The battery on my X1 Carbon 6th gen is not charging - it's stuck at 0% when I plug in the charger. Based on some reading I suspect the battery may have gotten below some protection threshold voltage and will no longer charge. The laptop was left unplugged and uncharged while I was away for the past couple weeks. (The reason this happened is the USB-C charging ports have gotten loose and sometimes randomly become disconnected  allowing the battery to reach 0% even though I ""left it plugged in."")  I hear it can be possible to revive a battery in this situation if you force it to charge - but I'm not sure how exactly to do this  or if it's even possible. I haven't found any software tools that can force charging. Could I take the battery out and hook it up to a DC constant current power supply? But I'm not even sure if the +/- pins are even connected directly to the cells without going through some control chips that only allow charging when controlled by the laptop via the  data pins.",negative,2021-12-17

Thinkpad recommendations for running Linux for University.,Hello  People Of r/thinkpad   I am a Computer Science student and would soon have to get a laptop for university.  I have a Windows desktop at home which is enough for my regular workflow (editing  games  browsing  stuff)  so I don't need another windows computer. I have finally decided to make my transition to Linux for university workflow.  I asked the guys at r/linux for laptop recommendations and many of them suggested getting a ThinkPad  and that it's 'gold standard' for running Linux.  I went to the Lenovo (India) [website](https://www.lenovo.com/in/en/thinkpad) to check out the ThinkPad laptops and was welcomed by the overwhelming and confusing number of options and lineups offered by Lenovo.  There is:  1) X1 Series  2) X Series  3) Edge Series  4) T Series  5) Yoga Series  6) L Series  7) P Series  Then there are the respective offerings in these lineups.  Can someone please explain the different series  their pros and cons  and which of the thinkpads are best/ tried and tested for running Linux?  I am from India and recommendations from people in India will be most helpful (due to prices and availability differences in regions)  however  I am open to suggestions from people around the world.  Also  I've been thinking of getting a Debian based distro  but I am open to suggestions/recommendations for which distro would be best suited for this (preferably vanilla distros without bloatware  which look good  are easy to use).

Using only free software on Thinkpad T480,Hello  r/thinkpad!  I'm considering to buy an used T480 which is getting pretty inexpensive these days.  I'm planning to buy one and flash its BIOS with the image where Intel ME is neutralized with [me_cleaner](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner) and wlan whitelist is removed with [this patch](https://github.com/digmorepaka/thinkpad-firmware-patches).  I searched on the internet but couldn't find any material on replacing a wlan card with a card that can be used with linux-libre kernel which deblob all non-free firmware that includes Intel wlan card firmware that is needed for the default wlan of T480.  In short  using linux-libre kernel  you can expect that the default wlan card will not work.  I'm not sure that the default card really isn't working with the linux-libre kernel though.  Do you have any material or can you share any experience on:  - neutralizing Intel ME on T480 with me_cleaner - removing wlan whitelist on T480 - replacing the default wlan card on T480 with a card that works with the linux-libre kernel. - if the default wlan card is working with the linux-libre kernel  please tell me about it.

I found a great use for an outdated ThinkPad that can't be used as your daily driver!,Hi! If you own a ThinkPad that can run Windows 10 (possibly Windows 7 too but I'm not sure) but is a very low spec and can't handle most of your work  you can use it as a keyboard and mouse (TrackPoint works too!) for your main workstation PC. Here's how:  1. Download the official [Mouse Without Borders app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35460) developed by a Microsoft employee and verified in Microsoft Garage. 2. Connect the two computers to the same network.  3. Do all the setup steps to connect the two (it should somewhat guide you). 4. There you go! Not only can your ThinkPad control your newer PC  your newer PC can control it!  Let me know if this works for you!

Recommendations on Thinkpad for light duty programming on the go,I recently bought a T470 from ebay  which has been a great workhorse for me for home programming projects. I've got Ubuntu Installed on it  but looking to go deeper into other linux distros. I've caught the bug  as they say  and I need another Thinkpad to tinker with on the go. I've done a bit of digging and I feel very good about today's offerings in the E series. But  I would like to hear about other models I should consider or about any downsides I might have missed with these newer Thinkpads. Here is a description of what I am looking for.  * Lowish power consumption. * Decent battery life. I should not have to charge until EOD. Would like to replace the battery in 2-3 years. * Good enough for light browsing  web app programming  ssh into my servers from the couch or remotely.  * Low storage  but want nvme SSD. I would not store a lot of data on this device  not to be used as gaming or video editing  etc. * Ultra-portable or smallish FF and slim would be ideal. 13 -14 inch would be preferable and should easily fit in a small commuter backpack. * 8GD ram to start; I'm leaning towards running Manjaro KDE on this one to experiment. I would like to be able to replace/extend this to 16BG  but would like to see how it goes with 8GB  I don't think I need more than that. * 300 - 600 dollars budget range.

Anyone know any trick to getting at the CPU on an X201T?,My i7 X201T has been thermaling and shutting down occasionally and I think it needs a new thermal pasting.  But according to the HMM this requires completely disassembling the machine down to removing the screen  every component and the mobo and doing it  then reassembling everything.

Touchpad and trackpoint not working(X1 C 5th),I've had this issue for a few weeks where my touchpad would start shuttering and the pointer moved strange like in a grid  after that the trackpoint stoped working(including the buttons) and only the trackpad worked  until this point after a restart and/or reinstalling the touchpad drivers it worked again. Yesterday I used my laptop as usual in the morning  everything was working well until I tried to use it at night and the trackpad nor the trackpoint worked. In addition to checking software-wise I also tried in the diagnosis menu when booting to make sure it's not OS related  I also opened the laptop and made sure the connection to the trackpad was correctly seated  also cleaned it but nothing seems to resolve the issue.  This is driving me crazy since it's the main device I use when I'm not at home  I'd really appreciate the help if you have any ideas.,positive,2021-12-17

ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 WorkStation Dock - Wired LAN Ethernet Chipset?,"Hello All      I'm a recent owner of a new Thinkpad P1 Gen 4 (i7-11850 with iGPU).     I'm looking to get a Thunderbolt 4 dock for it and I've been considering either the TB4 Universal Dock (40B00135xx) or the TB 4 Workstation Dock (40B00300xx). Because it's a P1  I think it makes more sense to go with the Workstation dock (rather than the Universal) as it has the appropriately rated external power supply and the TB + power split cable. I think the docks themselves are the same anyway  it's just that the peripherals included differ.     These docks have a wired LAN ethernet interface and from the research I've been able to do  there's two possible LAN chipsets that the docks potentially ship with.  One of them is an 1GbE Realtek Chip and the other is a 2.5GbE Intel i225 chip.     I'm not a fan of the Realtek chips and so I trying to work out how I might be able to ensure that Lenovo ship out the dock with the Intel chipset and not the Realtek one. The ordering process doesn't allow for that level of specificationt and it's not a question that the online or phone based front line Lenovo support/chat staff are able to answer.  I hoping the community could provide some guidance  evidence and experience in terms of what the chipsets are in your Lenovo TB 4 docks (for those that have them) .I haven't been able to find any differences in the part numbers etc so I'm at a bit of a loss.     Reference is made to both the Realtek and Intel chipsets on Lenovo's support pages:  Drivers and Software &gt;&gt; ""Driver Readme"" and ""Firmware Readme"".

How long should a Thinkpad P52 or any mobile workstation last ?,Hello fellow Thinkpad lovers!!  I’m a mechanical engineering student and a Thinkpad fan. I have a Thinkpad P52 with i7-8850H vPro processor  NVIDIA Quadro P1000 4GB   16 GB of RAM and an outstanding 2TB ssd nvme .   Till this day   this machine has been able to surpass anything that I throw at it . Things like big Solidworks assemblies   heavy simulations   big CFD simulations (except for ram wich of course I can upgrade to a max of 128 GB non ecc or 64 GB ecc) and even heavy and intensive python code.   My question is  assuming that I’m very careful about my laptop and don’t put anything fancy on it and take care of not using more power demanding stuff that it can tolerate  how should my P52 last saying that I will add RAM accordingly to keep up with my needs. Thanks for your help.   Ps: Some of you might say we cannot predict something like that. It’s my first workstation so I don’t know how long Thinkpad mobile workstation last but have been a thinkpad user for a long time having 1 x200   1 x301 and 1 x1 carbon gen1 and all are still working great to this day (linux obviously and btw I dont mind to use linux alongside Windows).,negative,2021-12-16

planning for future P51 CPU fan replacement,I understand fan noise/cooling issues with the P51 have been discussed here before (examples [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/8l6s2c/p51_rattling_fan/)  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/6sqy6q/warning_for_p51_and_p71_buyers/)). I bought mine in 2017  and had no issues for the first three years of use. Around this time last year the fan noise became noticeably louder. Since I had an extended warranty  Lenovo sent someone to my home to repair it  with several delays. By the time of the repair  it sounded like an engine and was throttling and artifacting really badly. IIRC they ended up replacing the entire mainboard as well as the cooling unit.  After a year of being fine  the rattling noise is back  though it hasn't gotten super bad yet. Anticipating that this might happen  I had extended the warranty again last year (\~$120 I think) to the max length  to September 2022. It seems like the obvious next step right now is to get another Lenovo warranty repair  but I'm trying to think through how I will deal with this if it happens yet again  but after the warranty runs out. I'd like to make my laptop last as long as possible.  The repair guy last time let me keep the old cooling unit:  https://preview.redd.it/yy1l7k9olu281.jpg?width=807&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0d57bb8e9e4a5cf1931eeb1b0796e5fca06d369d  The fan on the right side has the most resistance to turning  suggesting it was the noise culprit last time around. Comparing to the inside view of the very similar P50 in [this video](https://youtu.be/YpMRS9mDxDo?t=3045)  I see that the fan on the right side in this image (also the right side if you're facing the laptop) is the CPU fan. That's the same side the noise is coming from this time around.  One option might be to buy a [replacement heatsink+fans](https://www.amazon.com/Genuine-ThinkPad-Cooling-Heatsink-01AV342/dp/B07GWWZL8H) (\~$130+shipping) and attempt to do the swap myself if and when the problem reoccurs after warranty expiration  in late 2022 or beyond. I could wait until then to buy the replacement  though I worry the part may be harder to source in the future.  It looks like replacements for the offending CPU fan itself [can be found](https://www.ebay.com/itm/362873120256) for much cheaper. Examining my old unit  the fan part seems to attach to the heatsink with three tiny screws and some tape.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ofiw1ljfou281.jpg?width=807&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c1d55aec71d2aed14e32b0237328900c9bb347bc  Would regular ol' electric tape work for this? Does anyone know if any aftermarket products exist for this  to avoid a perpetual cycle of fan replacements?  Any thoughts appreciated.,positive,2021-12-16
X12 Detachable Linux - 2021.11.30,Linux update for those who care.  I decided to give the X12 Detachable a whirl  but I tend to run Linux everywhere. So  naturally  I decided to give Linux a shot on this machine. I'm sad to report that not much has changed in the last 8-ish months since the first post about this very topic here in r/thinkpad.  What does *not* work:  * The speakers. This actually didn't bother me much since Bluetooth works fine. * Trackpoint is completely non-functional. It works fine in Windows and while navigating the BIOS menu  but it's just wasted space when you boot into Linux.  I'm currently not sure if I'm going to keep the machine at this rate. It's a shame because it's a beautiful piece of hardware and works like a charm in Linux with the exception of the above issues. I just really hate that I'm unable to use the trackpoint. The fan seemed to constantly run in Windows  but now I barely hear it. Touchscreen seems to work perfectly and it can run relatively heavy workloads without fail (though  keep in mind  my goal was to mainly use it for entertainment and some light work).  I tried all of this using openSUSE Tumbleweed 20211128. I tried GNOME with Wayland and Xorg (Wayland was better)  and then I tried with KDE Plasma. I'm not usually a GNOME fan  but they've done great work with touchscreen gestures  all of which work without issue on the X12 detachable.   I'd hoped that using a rolling distribution would mean I'd encounter fewer issues  but it seems I was wrong (at least in regards to the speakers and trackpoint). If anyone out there has more information  I'm all ears - my research has turned up very little. For the rest out there  be warned: it works fine  but the speakers and trackpoint might cause you some grief.,positive,2021-12-17

P1G4 RTX 3070 vs RTX A2000,Need some advice on my recent P1G4 purchase. I've had my P1G4 for 10 days now and it is a keeper  no issues with any of the reported annoyances. The only thing I really hate is the huge 230W power Supply and thick non portable power plug that came with it. I'm thinking of exchanging it for another P1G4 with the 170W but there are a few other differences:  1) New model would be $300 cheaper than the one I got   2) New model will have 32GB in dual channel mode instead of the 32GB in single channel   3) New model will have 1180H instead of the 11850H   4) New model will have  16.0” WQUXGA (3840 x 2400)  with Dolby Vision  HDR 400  600 nits  instead of  16.0” WQXGA (2560 x 1600)   400 nits    5) New model will have the  NVIDIA® RTX™ A2000 4GB  instead of the RTX 3070  So  Looks like the only downgrade would be the graphic card  everything else is better in my mind plus i get to save $300.

BIOS Time - Slow?,I've got a Lenovo X1 Thinkpad Yoga Gen 6  with an aftermarket Samsung 980 Pro SSD. Curious if anyone with similar setups notice slow BIOS times. I get around 6s for a boot from off  and 8s doing a restart.  For reference  my HP Spectre X360 (2015  i7-6500U 2.50ghz  8gb ram  HP ssd) gets a BIOS time of 2.7s.

X13 Gen2 Amd or M1 MBA,Okay so I am guessing a lot of the replies here will be biased as this is the ThinkPad Reddit. I am going back and forth repeatedly and need help deciding what laptop to get.   My main uses: vscode  YouTube  music  web browsing  and other light everyday use.   My choices: Base model m1 MacBook Air. 8gb ram  256gb ssd. - $900  Or  X13 gen2 amd. Ryzen7 5850u  32gb ram  1TB ssd  the 2k display option  fingerprint reader. - $1099 through yesterday’s deal.   I like the look and feel of the MBA  the keyboard and display feel and look nicer in my opinion. The m1 chip seems to be extremely fast without much struggle.  The x13 has a lot more Ram  more hd space  has a lot more ports than just 2 thunderbolt ports. If I went with the MBA I could always use external hd space or cloud storage and I think the resell value would be higher than the x13.,negative,2021-12-16
Lenovo Yoga X1 Thinkpad - Remove Hello for Sleep,"Hello all   Recently got the Lenovo Yoga X1 Thinkpad  and I was able to install a Samsung SSD  and with Windows Update &amp; Vantage it looks like I've got all the apps  settings  and drivers in place - however  there is one thing that drives me crazy - I would like to remove the fingerprint/pin requirement from waking from sleep.

USB Type-C power supply on thinkpad x220,"I have my second one now.. And although it ""works"" it doesn't seem to fit/snap into place  previously I used a load of blu-tak to hold it in place but now I'm using card... this can't be right  I was wondering if my case in this area is somehow damaged causing it not to fit properly.  I'm trying to find clean/clear pictures of this area of this case with and without other components around it  so I can compare and maybe work around it.  I'm thinking or just glue it into place with some industrial grade super glue or something but if people can point out where it might be broken that would be a God send...  I should check how much a new shell costs.  &amp;#x200B;  Kind of don't want to part of with my thinkpad x220... it still performs great.. I corebooted it  so it boots like a lightining bolt.  I can still upgrade it's ram and CPU yet for huge performance boosts.. the next laptop I'll buy will probably be for another 5 years yet.  And I just adore the track-point which I can't find on any other laptop (patents are dumb).  when an ARM laptop comes out which can match or outperform the thinkpad x220 while using equal or less power and has a track-point then I'll switch to it  but for now it doesn't look like that.

Upgrading my t480s.,I have had my t480s which I absolutely love for almost 2 and a half years now.   It has an i5 8250u/ Integrated Graphics/8GB of RAM/ 256GB SSD.

A friend told me that instead of going through that trouble i should just sell this one and get a better laptop/PC  but quite frankly I don't want to.  I want to get you guy's opinion on that.

[Question] T500 vs T400   and LTE modem?,Hello.  After my post previousely  I decided to go to a T400 or T500.

Downloaded Lenovo Recovery Image seems nicer than the factory image,I just painstakingly downloaded the Lenovo recovery image after installing a 'clean' microsoft windows image on my T14s AMD  and never getting the drivers exactly right (despite downloading them off the lenovo website). It took forever to install the damn thing  but to my surprise it has installed commercial vantage instead of gross consumer vantage! That's definitely a difference from what I remember from the old factory image. Also there is absolutely no stupid ad-like tiles in the start menu  but that might be the same (except of course a pre-installed ms office  but that's fine).

T470s for learning/experimenting with Linux?,Hey all  I’m looking at buying a used Thinkpad to play around with Linux and teach myself a few programming languages as I’m going into a Masters degree soon and will be doing some bioinformatics work as part of it. It’s not my first Thinkpad as the NSW government gave me an x131e when I was in Year 9 in 2013 and when I had to give it back after finishing high school  I’ve yearned for the trackpoint ever since!  I currently have an i7 Surface Laptop with 16GB of RAM and have built a fairly capable desktop too  but I’d like to get something pretty cheap from eBay (likely refurbished) with a budget of around $400-450 AUD ($285ish USD before tax). I want to be able to put in some extra sodimm RAM I have lying around as well as a new 1TB SSD that I bought for my desktop but haven’t bothered to install. I’m then planning on dual-booting either Ubuntu and Windows or possibly installing ChromeOS for fun. It doesn’t have to be powerful  but I want it to feel pretty smooth.   I’ve never bought or upgraded and older laptop before though - only fiddled with broken ones I have at home. If I get a supposedly “seller refurbished” model  it’s probably best if I upgrade the battery  right? Can I trust third party eBay batteries? Where do you all get parts for your Thinkpads  particularly if you’re based in Australia?  Also  with an eBay coupon for 15% off I’ve found a T470S i5-6300U with 8GB RAM and a 256GB drive for $380 AUD including GST ($271 USD total). It’s got the FHD touch screen but I’m not too fussed about upgrading that (unless it really sucks)  and seems to be in pretty good condition. Does that sound like a fairly good price or am I being ripped off? Does anyone know if that’s just 8GB of soldered RAM or likely to be 4+4GB?   I’m so keen to get involved and thanks in advance for your help!,negative,2021-12-16

ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 Won`t Charge on Planes,Hi  I purchased a Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 2 during the pandemic and have loved the machine so far. I have to travel frequently now for a new position and today is the first time since I purchased the device that I flew because of the pandemic.  On the plane  I attempted to charge the device and it would not charge.   I did some Googling after the flight and learned that others have had this problem and this may be related to how much power the device draws (this occurred with airplane mode on). It seems that something must be wrong with my machine as I find it hard to believe that this laptop can\`t charge on planes using the provided outlets. Would it not just be possible for Lenovo to configure the device to draw less power when used on a plane? I imagine many of their customers are in a similar situation as me and need to use their laptop on the go especially when flying.  However  if it really is the case that it can\`t charge on flights I would have to buy a new laptop as I need to be able to complete work on long flights in my new position. If anyone has any advice on how to fix this I would appreciate it! I called Lenovo support and explained the situation and they were not very helpful.,negative,2021-12-17

X1E/P1 gen 4 -- are they really that bad?!,Since I'm considering a new machine to take advantage of the holiday season deals I'm curious if we have any sort of definitive summary of the pros and cons (although no doubt it'll be mainly cons) of the gen 4 versions of the X1E and P1.  I've read a lot of reviews over the past few months that suggest all models run hot (vapor chamber or not)  that fans are always on (and some reviews suggest those fans are significantly louder than those from other brands' machines)  that the CPU constantly throttles in non-vapor-chamber models  that the overall build quality has dropped... I could go on. But I'm curious if any of those issues can be considered more than just anecdotal and if they are any worse than previous generations. Let's face it  everyone has always complained about fan noise with Thinkpads (it's why TPFanControl exists) so it's hard to determine just how bad the latest gen really is.  I currently have an X1E gen 1 ( i7-8850H  GTX 1050Ti  32GB) and find it a pretty quiet machine overall.  Fans do kick up on occasion when I'm doing some graphics or coding stuff  but not for long. For general productivity work (generally MS Office  email  and a dozen Chrome tabs) the machine is usually dead silent when docked.  If I were to get a gen 4 machine (i7-11800H  RTX 3050Ti  32GB)  am I looking at a world of noise and headaches by comparison?!,negative,2021-12-16

High End Thinkpads Advice,"I have done some good amount of research  but for some reason no thinkpad is working properly for me and I looking for advice now. I am even considering the new macbook  knowing I adore thinkpads.  What I am looking for is a high-end thinkpad:  1. great keyboard+touchpad 2. 6-8 cores (was really interested in AMD) 3. a GPU if I decide to play games (I don't play really demanding games  but I don't want it to stop me from playing games when I want to)  so 2-4GB should be plenty. I have read that the integrated graphics have come a long way  but I still have my doubts on it. If I am mistaken on this please feel free to update me. 4. Not have thermal issues ... 5. 14""  but can take a 15"". The 14"" have a nicer keyboard layout than the 15"" models. 13 are out of the discussion. 6. Somewhat light-weight  The X1 Carbon Gen 9 was looking really solid  but lacks graphics cards. X1E G4 is out of stock and isn't that big of an upgrade on the issues faced in G3 version.  I really felt compelled to check the MBP with the new M1  but I don't enjoy how restrictive the mac ecosystem is in terms of OS  hardware  and the M1 is still growing in terms of adoption in terms of software and drivers.

Ultranav buttons worn out/defective,The other day I finally got my first ThinkPad. Wanted to go for a compact classic so I got an x230 from a very kind German guy that included 4 GB of upgraded RAM  an mSATA SSD  the docking station  two chargers and a thinkpad branded bag. Now I would like to mod it a bit/fix the things that went bad with time.  The righ click of the ultranav is not getting back up for the whole key travel. Probably it got just worn out  but I would like to know if it's repairable with some DIY and good manners.  I was thinking of swapping the keyboard with the x220 classic majesty  since also the del key is broken (sadly  I have to admit my responsibility in this). I found another guy  also here in Germany selling the keyboard for a *very* good price. The part is defective  and the problem is with the central ultranav button. I am thinking having a go. The central question here is: are ultranav buttons fixable?  Since I'm really enjoyng the device  I am also considering investing a bit.

x13 Gen2 AMD or T420,Okay so I am at a dilemma right now. I currently have a T420 (i5-2540 @ 2.6gGHz  8GB Ram  500GB SSD  newer battery and I did the screen swap to 1600x900).

Wow! Lenovo customer service is totally awesome.,This is how you customer service!   I Bought a Lenovo Thinkpad P1 for $3 179 on 11/11  I was supposed to get 11% cash back from Rakuten on top of the “Doordash” sale price.   There was an issue because I created a Lenovo PRO account on checkout since I am a small business. That made me no longer eligible for the 11% cash back. This is not made clear at all and the Rakuten extension still said I was getting the 11% cash back.   I confirmed today that Rakuten is not giving me cash back. So I lost out on the $349.  I checked Lenovo today and it’s now 15% cash back for cyber Monday.  So I called Lenovo Customer service and explained what happened. Not knowing what to expect but I figured it was worth a shot.   This awesome dude apologized  said it’s a wonky situation with pro vs not pro accounts and it needs to be fixed by Rakuten. He says “this is going to be slightly annoying  but worth it”.  He then gives me a custom quote for the same exact machine at $2 349 AND I can process it through the consumer page (not pro) and also get the additional 15% back from Rakuten.  The only hassle is that I have to return the current machine when the new one arrives.  which means setting everything up again  etc. for me  that is a few hours process.

Considering moving back from T14 AMD to T450s,Hi all   Please tell me I'm just being ridiculous. About a year back I received a new T14 AMD via work. It's fast  has decent battery life  generally plays nice with Void Linux  all in all a pretty decent machine. However  I still miss my previous laptop  a T450s. The T450s was my first Thinkpad  just feels a lot better during day to day use. The outside feels nice and sturdy  the keyboard is miles ahead of the T14   and to be honest  speed-wise it's okay for most uses for me. So  I'm considering moving back to my old laptop. Now  this just feels like a dumb idea to be honest  and I don't think I should do this. My new laptop has a nice 1 TB NVME drive in it  whereas this T450s just has a 250 GB SSD  and I don't think I can move the NVME drive to the old laptop. It's just a dumb idea really.  Anyway  what I'm asking is: have any of you moved back to an older model after purchasing a new one? Or are there any good models that retain the sturdiness and good keyboard of the T450s whilst having the power of the newer models? Cause the T14 just ain't it  you know.,neutral,2021-12-17

New Lenovo Thinkpad Repeatedly Turning Off/Shutting Down, I bought this laptop a week or so ago. It was working fine as far as I can tell. I started using it while it was being charged and it would just repeatedly turn off  from being able to turn on and work for a few minutes before shutting down  to that process just ramping up  it'll be in the middle of restarting on the Lenovo splash and it'll turn off again. When out of the plug now it does the same thing.  I figured it was just my laptop having trouble pushing air out of the desktop mat so I now have it propped up on an unpowered laptop fan mat and it was working fine uncharged. But when I started charging it  the laptop got hotter and the problem started happening again. I used this laptop uncharged at the tables in a barnes and nobles earlier today and I didn't run into this problem for the hour I was there coding.  I tried installing ALL updates onto my computer  updated my system bios  and it just continues to happen. I don't understand how or why. My laptop is shutting off at 40C while used uncharged and 51C charging.  Are laptops supposed to turn off at those small temperatures? I used to have a rig that would run at 90-110C and never shut down.,negative,2021-12-16

T14s AMD gen2. Is there ANY way to get regular boring “sleep” to work?,I’ve got a shiny new T14s  gen2  AMD Ryzen 7  type 20XF.  I’m coming from an Intel Carbon X1 6 gen where I regularly put the computer to sleep when traveling or whatever.  My new T14s seems to love to crash ALL THE TIME whenever I try to put it to sleep.  Some basic research has led me to believe that this is SOME combination of being AMD instead of Intel  being new  Windows 10 “hybrid sleep”  the sleep setting in BIOS  and/or AMD drivers.    Needless to say I’m less than thrilled with my new crash pad— does anyone know of a set of settings or drivers or whatever that will allow this combination of behaviors?  At this point I’m willing to reinstall the OS if I need to  but working through every possibility is something I’m hoping to avoid.  I ultimately need (well  want… but want pretty badly?) - Windows 10 - a low-power state that resumes within a couple of seconds but uses little enough power that I can safely put the machine into a backpack overnight and not have it overheat or totally run the battery dead.   - a low-power state that won’t wake itself up other than on command (the original install that came with the machine did this) - a low power state that won’t decide for me when to go into a deeper hibernate-like state (the original install also did this)  This doesn’t SEEM like too much to ask for out of a $1500 laptop in 2021  but I guess maybe I’m just hard to please?,negative,2021-12-17

Please point me int he right direction.,"I'd like to buy a Thinkpad T series. It would be docked most of the time but would like it to be useable as an actual laptop as well so I don't think I could live with myself if I got a 1080 screen in 2021. Ideally  I'd like to get something higher than 1080p or 4K. It would be mostly for spreadsheet/browser based work but I would like to occasionally game natively without an eGPU. Gaming would be Minecraft  Factorio  Sprite-based games so nothing crazy like BF or COD. Would prefer to have a 15"" screen and a numpad. I was looking at a T15G but it looks like it's 4+ months to ship and I'd like to having something within the next few weeks. Is there another place besides lenovo's website to buy these? My budget is $2k-$3K.",positive,2021-12-15

"How to enable T430 Trackpoint ""Press-to-Select"" on W10?",I've been putting this off for far too long. Any ultranav driver to enable this feature?

T14 Gen 1 - Intel i7 10610U - Dual 4k60hz possible?,Hello  I have a T14 from work and recently purchased two 4k monitors. I've tried just about every combination and cannot seem to run 2x 4k at 60hz. Something tells me this laptop configuration does not have enough bandwidth to support dual 4k monitors at 60hz. Here's what I tried:  Scenario 1:  lenovo USB C Gen 2 dock (Non thunderbolt) - 4k only at 30hz   usb C to DP connected to laptop thunderbolt port directly- 4k at 60hz  scenario 2:  Anker thunderbolt 4 dock connected to thunderbolt port on laptop  1st usb C to DP cable connected to dock - 1 4k60hz    2nd usb C to DP cable connected to dock - can't even turn on lol.  Scenario 3:  Anker thunderbolt 4 dock connected to thunderbolt port on laptop  1st usb C to DP cable connected to dock - 1 4k60hz    2nd usb C to DP cable connected to USB C port on laptop (non thunderbolt) - 4k30hz.  &amp;#x200B;  Interestingly  my MacBook Pro can display 4k60hz through this non thunderbolt Lenovo dock but the T14 cannot. I have a feeling the thunderbolt 3 port on the T14 does not have enough bandwidth for 2 4k60hz monitors.  &amp;#x200B;  Has anyone been able to get 2x 4k60hz working for they Gen 1 T14 intel laptop?

What to do with a used 4-5 year old thinkpad that I want to replace?,I have been using a thinkpad for more than 15 years... I replace mine every 4-5 years  when the battery has lost about 50% of it's mojo  but I can never figure out what to do with the old one. The tricky part is that I exclusively run linux  and in any case  I would never sell my laptop without securely scrubbing the harddisk  or just removing it entirely. So the old laptop just sits there for a couple of more years until I decide to e-recycle it  and then feel guilty that had I not procrastinated  I could have at least tried to donate it or something.  Does anyone have suggestions on how I should handle this going forward?

Upgrade from X270 (i5 7300U + 16GB + M2 SSD) for something more performance  but budget.,Im looking for upgrade/second performance notebook for video editing in Davinci Resolve  all other stuff to do it's lighter than movie edition and rendering. I was thinking about T470p with 7th gen CPU  but don't know if upgrade will be enought and also will be a bit expensive  another idea was to get T440P and upgrade CPU and RAM for something better. Like i7 4710MQ which has around 1k points less in [cpubenchmark.com](https://cpubenchmark.com) than i7 7700HQ from T470p and still more than 2k points more than my current i5 7300U. Both should have higher performance with dual-channel RAM which I don't have in X270... My thoughts are that to build T440p on the budget use it only for high-performance task  and X270 for the rest  and save money for X1 Extreme Gen2 and sell both thinkpads after.

Buy P1 Gen4 / X1e Gen4 now or wait for 12th Gen Alder Lake?,There are some amazing deals right now on the good builds of the P1 Gen4 / X1 Extreme Gen4 laptops this weekend (eg. 3060/A3000+ w/vapor chamber cooling)  but I'm torn between pulling the trigger now and waiting for 12th Gen Alder Lake updates. 12th Gen should have decent platform upgrades (pcie5  ddr5)  run a lot quieter / cooler and have much better mixed use battery life from light tasks loading up the efficiency cores first. Performance wise 12th Gen also looks like +15%/+50% single/multi at 45-60w (eg. 12800h vs 11800h).     Assuming Lenovo announces the 12th Gen Alder Lake updates at CES in early January any guesses as to when the P1 Gen5 / X1 Extreme Gen5 will ship? Gen4 has a brand new chassis design they're unlikely to update so it should be a quick refresh unless they decide to go with ddr5 and have to wait for supply to improve.     Should I buy P1 Gen4 / X1e Gen4 now and enjoy the huge discounts and the not having to wait around for several months for Lenovo to actually ship the 12th Gen machines they announce at CES? Or wait for that 12th Gen goodness?,negative,2021-12-17

X270 Frozen Blank Screen after FWUPD from Linux Distro -- FIXED,This is NOT me asking for help - I fixed my issue  but I know some people get this problem as well and it's worth another coin in the well on how to manage this problem. It actually gave me a bit of a scare.  Context: I installed Zorin Lite 15.3. They offered me two individual new files from FWUPD  which I guess they notify people with on their distro. I've never seen anyone actively do this. Usually  I'd need to go to the FWUPD site myself to look at documentation on what I'm doing if I'm not updating my board firmware through a version of Windows.  Well  I let the files run naturally to see if they'd actually go through and give me an easy time. I'm a tweaker and tinkerer at heart; I get curious to see what happens. By allowing these firmware updates to take place  they actually looked fine at first. Board inserts a new capsule  board updates a portion of the firmware  it should probably reboot after that  right? **Right?**  Apparently  it semi-power froze on me and I haven't dealt with this before. Screen went blank with the backlight on  the fans were going  keyboard backlight still worked  but that was it. I couldn't shut it off even with pressing the power button for a while. This was clearly an issue. I thought I would take my external battery out and let the internal drain. Then I realized we have pinhole resets  so I gave that a whirl with the internal battery being the only power it'd get.  After the reset  the X270 returned to normal. I was thoroughly surprised the fix was that easy. Afterwards  I went to FWUPD and got my updates more properly. I should have recorded what the files actually were while still in Zorin before I went to reboot  but that didn't occur to me when I was setting up the distro and got distracted by other things.   Have a nice day y'all. Hope this helps you.   **tl;dr -- if you get a blank screen and power freeze after updating your motherboard  try a pinhole reset**,positive,2021-12-17

Returning my X1 Extreme Gen 4 - Here's why,"Hi all   My X1E4 (**20Y5000UUS  i7 11800H  RTX 3060  16 GB RAM  4K non-touch)** arrived a few days ago and I plan to return it. I was really excited about it because it has been 6 years since I bought my last laptop (which was also a Lenovo) and I expected a huge improvement but . . .. I really gave it a chance but I just cannot convince myself that I bought a ""PREMIUM"" laptop that is not premium at all.   Before purchasing the laptop  I was hesitant between X1E4 and Dell XPS 15 but after hours and hours of reading reviews and considering prices and specs  I went with the Lenovo. What really made me do this was the fact that X1E4 was less expensive for almost the same specs and better port selection (XPS 15 does not have USB A or HDMI).   All in all  I am returning this laptop. Here is the summary of my experience with the laptop and the reason behind returning it:  1. HDR does not actually work (lags in every situation). So I paid \~2500 CAD to get a shitty 8-bit 4k display. Dell XPS 15 display is vastly superior (better response time  color gamut) 2. Runs terribly hot! What annoys me is the fact that in almost every review this was mentioned but I read some posts here from owners saying that their laptop runs just fine. So I gave it a shot and guess what? naaaah  IT IS HOT. This problem is noticeable since palm rest is made of conductive material. My left hand sweats while gaming! Middle top part of the chassis (just below the screen) is even worse. Although in normal use you never touch that area but it is still annoying. While gaming I touched that area to see if it's hot and I think the heat I felt is just below the range you cannot keep touching it! It is also very loud under load. For gaming  that is not a problem for me since I use a headset but I am a student and I am pretty sure if I run demanding tasks on it when in university  people around me would definitely get annoyed! 3. I have not completely tested the battery life but I think it will last for like 4 hours doing regular stuff like web browsing. It lasted around 3 hours watching a full HD movie so . . . 4. iGPU cannot even handle the lightest tasks like Youtube and web browsing. I do not know why. It probably has to do with drivers but I tried everything and still no luck! When I disable iGPU in bios  everything runs smoothly but needless to say  it runs even warmer and I do not even need to mention the battery life on dGPU. 5. The screen has backlight bleeding/IPS glow. I don't know which one it is and I don't care. What matters is that there is a glow on all four corners of the screen  especially the bottom left (pic below). 6. This is not probably important but ketboard backlight is not that bright. 7. If someone unfamiliar with the phrase ""fingerprint magnet"" asks you what it means  without explaining anything  you can just introduce them to this laptop!!!!! It is the definition of fingerprint magnet. This applies to both the palm rest and the exterior surface. 8. Power brick and its cables are too bulky and heavy. Since the battery life is not great  you have to carry them everywhere obviously. This is completely disappointing  at least for me because the main reason I went for this laptop was the fact that it weighed only 2kg while offering high performance. If weight was not an issue  everyone would have opted for gaming laptops which are more powerful and cooler. 9. Almost all reviews and owner's comments I have read mentioned a Samsung SSD but mine came with a model named **KXG7AZNV512G LA KIOXIA** which seems to be manufactured by Toshiba. 10.  RAM is single channel and I knew this before buying it and I had planned to upgrade it but some people had said that their laptop came with a dual-rank module  but mine did not. It is Micron **8ATF2G64HZ-3G2E2 ** a single-rank stick. So in order to get a decent performance I have to somehow sell my stick and get 2 dual rank 16GB sticks which cost more than 150 CAD. As you probably know the difference between single-channel single rank and dual-channel dual rank is not negligible. My Cinebench R23 (Multi-Core) point was around 10500 while dual-channel models are \~ 12500 (check notebookcheck's reviews). 11. I love the trackpad. It is sooo smooth and feels really nice. Keyboard travel is not great but I don't have any problem with it. 12. CPU undervolting is not possible! Lenovo has locked this feature and there is no way around it. This is disappointing since undervolting could have probably made thermal throttling issue partly solved (I think undervolting is available for Dell XPS 15) but it seems that those who designed this machine were determined to make it as hot as possible!  There is a post in this subreddit that the guy who is also considering returning his X1E4 says **""I'm not feeling it!""** This is exactly what I feel now. I have a bad feeling like I am fooled by paying the premium price for a product with mediocre parts and engineering. What really bothers me is the fact that I know most laptops eventually start struggling with heat and performance after a few years but facing these issues from day one?! No  thank you. I know heat management and battery life issues are mostly due to Intel's horrible 11th gen but as a consumer  I don't care who made the mistake. What matters is that this laptop is not what it claims to be. I think I have to wait for laptops with Intel 12th gen CPUs and hope that they do not have these problems. Also  my last Lenovo laptop had its own ridiculous issues that made me promise myself I will never buy a laptop from Lenovo but I don't know how I ended up making the same mistake again!

Returned ThinkPad P1 Gen 4 today  some parting thoughts,My one-week-old P1 Gen 4 with RTX3070 is on its way back. I am going back to my X1E Gen 2. Some thoughts on my way back from UPS store:  1. I thought P1G4 would be an obvious all-around improvement comparing to X1E2  but it is more like a situation of three steps forward two steps back.    1. P1G4's performance  especially graphical performance is vastly superior comparing to X1E2  however also much louder under load. The increased noise level is creating a barrier for some of my use cases.     2. P1G4's keyboard is just worse than X1E2. The luxury ThinkPad typing experience is no more.    3. My P1G4 (1600p screen)'s battery life is about double of my X1E2 (4K IPS screen). That's significant improvement. However  the power brick also doubles in size and weight. And P1G4 comes with much thicker and heavier cables  and most importantly  Type B plug instead of Type A. No more international compatibility  you will need a travel converter.    4. I thought P1G4's integrated fingerprint reader in power button will work quicker than X1E2  I expect it works like my old Huawei laptop  which does one push power-on and fingerprint scan. But it doesn't. You push first  wait some seconds  and scan your finger on the power button. It takes exactly the same amount of time as X1E2's separate power button and fingerprint scanner. 2. I thought P1G4 would be powerful enough that I can retire my 5-year-old desktop with GTX1080 Ti. Turns out they perform about the same  and the desktop is much quieter. 3. If I don't have existing X1E2 or desktop PC  P1G4 would be a great machine to have. My problem was I hoped I can use the P1G4 to replace existing stuff and have an overall better experience. Perhaps I was expecting too much. 4. In my future purchase I will try to pay more attention to little things that typical online reviewers don't discuss much:    1. Noise under load  noise comparison    2. Keyboard and trackpad    3. Power brick  cables  and plug    4. Biometric device  how exactly does it work  I hope my experience could provide a couple useful data points for you. Welcome your questions and thoughts. Cheers!  P.S. my 2.5-year-old X1E2 still takes lovely pictures.  https://preview.redd.it/7r2f7op1p8281.jpg?width=4512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=711ba46899733747099b49f0c4202f129a73a336,neutral,2021-12-15

Delay Switching Speaker &lt;-&gt; Earphones (X1E G3),So whenever I plug into the 3.5mm Jack  there's a good 3 to 4 second delay in switching the audio device from the speaker to the earphone. The same problem exists when I remove the earphones. After the delay  the audio stutters for a decent 500ms before returning to normal  as if nothing ever happened.  I have tried the following:  - reinstalled realtek audio drivers - updated the bios - updated cpu / integrated GPU / dGPU drivers - tried troubleshooting with inbuilt tools - updated with vantage / windows settings  I also got on a call with a Thinkpad tech rep and we pretty much went over the above things.  At this point I am not really sure what's causing this issue  while being hopeful that it isn't a hardware issue (at least it doesn't look like one).  Any input would be appreciated  in addition to that if inquiring about the things I've already done helps to diagnose  I'll be happy to answer :),negative,2021-12-17

best use for old Yoga notebook,My son had an old notebook  a lenovo thinkpad type 20cd cto1ww  that he replaced and gave to me.

T14s Gen 2 acting strange (randomly turns on  then show fan error),So recently theres been strange things happening to my laptop  it happened before but I notice it happens way often now.   Sometimes when I just close the lid (plugged in or not)  after a few seconds it will turn on fans full speed for 10 seconds and stop. Another thing I noticed is sometimes after I shut it down (leaving the lid open)  I would comeback to see the laptop still on.   The most concerning thing is sometimes it randomly turns on again  and then show that there was a FAN ERROR  and turns off again. From all I know  this could be happening many times each day  when I'm not infront of it. I also recently notice the battery drain is a lot more compare to before even when doing light tasks (feels like 30% less battery life).  A few weird things also happened but so far only once  like fingerprint suddenly not working  and trackpoint and touchpad buttons stopped working for an hour then worked again.  Now that I listed all of that  I realized how much problems there was in this device.  This is my first thinkpad too  oh well. I was wondering if anyone else is experiencing this or if anyone has a suggestion to fix this.  I have the ryzen 5850u touchscreen version.

That said i am thinking about blowing out my windows partition and just using a vm if/when needed. But what about the license? is there a way to retrieve it?  I've been on a mac since 2007  moved my desktop to linux and now have my laptop on it as well. Windows is so bloated its taking up 100 gigs right now (\~60 gigs used) and i haven't installed anything. The only thing that worries me are bios updates.

Most future-proof option among available refurbished?,I need to grab a new laptop and am looking at some refurbished options from a local shop. It would be largely for web development and some simple GIS work (visualizing  no processing). Ideally durable  portable  and good battery life. Would be nice to game but I think I'd sacrifice that for more portable/good battery. I'm aware of the black friday sales lenovo has  but these refurbished prices are obviously considerably lower still and it seems like newer thinkpads are less serviceable/upgradeable. Do any of these stand out to you? I'm assuming anything with an i7 is the most future-proofed. I would be upgrading RAM and storage for most of these. Prices in USD.  $390 - X260 T i7-6600 dual core 8GB RAM/256G SSD  $310 - T440S i7-4600U   8GB RAM  240GB SSD   $390 -  T470s  i5-6300U  8GB DDR4 RAM  256GB SSD  $390 - T470  i5-6300U    8GB DDR4 RAM+ 240GB SSD  $390  - T540p   i7-4600M @ 2.90GHz 8GB RAM+ 240GB SSD    $390 - X1C  i5 6th Gen.

Checklist for ThinkPad Linux compatibility,I'm wondering if there is (or I can compile with help) a list of common issues to look for when assessing a ThinkPads Linux compatibility. The support seems to vary by range/model. The T14/P14s for example  which while they list Linux as an operating system on their product page  they had many issues such as the infamous S3 sleep drain (that took over a year to improve! and then only made it just about acceptable). Another example is the new P14s Gen 2 AMD seems to come with a Realtek WiFi that isn't well supported out the box.  So in summary  what are the common issues to look for? I'm currently weighing up a P14s G2 AMD and an X1 Carbon G9 and Linux compatibility will probably be the deciding factor. Which I need to assess within the 14 day return window. I suspect that if Lenovo don't offer a model with Linux as a preload  then there are known issues.  To kick things off  here are some things to look for:  WiFi (it connects and works after sleep resume)  S3 Sleep Drain (&lt;0.8w)  Hibernate (it resumes and everything still works)  Bluetooth (eg mouse/audio)  Touchpad (still works after resumes)  Idle drain (general power management  when using something like TLP  is comparable to Windows)  USB-C Docks (eg full resolution/refresh video  such as 4k/60hz)  Lid closure/open can trigger sleep/wake  Function keys work (eg mute  volume  brightness  etc),positive,2021-12-17

Installing Linux on a new X1 Extreme Gen 4.,Hi   I recently bought a new X1 Extreme Gen 4  i am tired of Windows 10 already.  My model is the i7-11800H  with Nvidia 3050Ti GPU  16GB RAM and 512GB SSD.  Has anyone had any luck in installing Pop_OS or Manjaro?   Will Pop_OS play well with the GPU? Manjaro?

T440 wireless problem,I bought a T440 one year ago. Everything was working fine  I was happy with it. Recently it started to have some problems. It can't find any wireless connection. As a workaround  I uninstalled the wireless drivers from device manager  restarted  then it was working again (win 10 reinstalls it automatically). This worked until suddenly  it didn't.  Using an ethernet cable works without issues.  I tried: 1. Reinstalling windows 2. Install manually the drivers from lenovo support 3. Used a tool to automatically detect necessary drivers (which didn't find anything for wireless) 4. Tried with WLAN AutoConfig in Services  setting it to automatic  I am aware of the Fn+F8  I am starting to believe that the problem might be hardware.

New ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 9) sometimes randomly beeps at me  but otherwise works perfectly,Hello reddit!  I recently got myself a ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 9) after over a decade of using only MacBooks. I'm in love with this computer! It's lighter than any MacBook I've owned  the materials feel way better  has a better keyboard  and works perfectly with Linux right out of the box.  However  I'm running into a bizarre issue: sometimes completely at random  the computer beeps at me like an old-timey alarm clock. It's a series of five beeps in pairs (*beep-beep* pause *beep-beep* pause *beep-beep* pause *beep-beep* pause *beep-beep*).  The Linux kernel logs report no errors  and all applications work as expected. I've only had the computer for a week  and this has happened twice since then. Once while I was typing normally  and another time when I woke it up from sleep by opening the lid.  What could the problem be? Should I be worried?,positive,2021-12-17

Need some advice on purchasing a thinkpad.,I want to buy a new laptop  came across thinkpads and i love the way they look. I could use some advice on deciding which one to purchase.   My eye fell on 2 refurbished thinkpads  the main difference being the screen resolution.   Option nr. 1 thinkpad x260  i5-6300u  780p. €295 -  option nr. 2 thinkpad x270  i5-6300u  1080p €355 -  I will be using the laptop to learn webdevelopment and programming  but i do have a proper desktop and the laptop is for on the go or in my bed on lazy sundays. And i will also be playing some light games on it  but since it's mainly older tomb raider/rayman games that should be more then fine. I will be upgrading the ram and ssd in the future  and hopefully the laptop will last a couple of years.  I'm on a budget  so the €60 - is a significant difference for me  so i only want to spend it if absolutely neccesary. Since the screen is only 12 5 inch i'm wondering if i would be able to tell the difference. And i was hoping someone could explain what the added benefits would be? And if it is worth it or not.  And as far as my google research told me  the difference between a x260 and x270 is minimal. Are there any significant differences between them that would tip the scales?  There is also a t470s  with a i5-6300u  1080p and 14 inch screen. But it's €445 - I could fit it in my budget but i'm having a real hard time justifying it. Is there a reason this version is more expensive other then resolution and screen size?   Thanks for the advice in advance!,negative,2021-12-15

My setup is currently a P1 Gen 4 with the i9  64g of RAM and a 3080. This is model number 20Y3004JUS  as per the label on the bottom of the machine. Currently running the latest bios (November 10 release). I have also never run windows on the machine - I booted straight into an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and installed that  totally wiping the system. I am running i3wm on of ubuntu 20.04. I use compton for display composition (really just for the transparent terminal backgrounds) and this has proved key to getting vsync working properly. I am currently running prime-select in on-demand mode. Latest nvidia 495 drivers grabbed from the usual ubuntu apt repos.   For a long while (well  a couple weeks) I was running the machine in Nvidia only mode  because I couldn't get applications like my CAD software and any games to run on the dGPU when in on-demand. The problem with nvidia only mode is the card idles at like 25-30w and takes about 3 hours off the already terrible battery life (meaning I would get 2-3 hours web browsing and nothing else before I had to charge). Anyway  turns out the solution to this really is as simple as getting the latest drivers  switching to on-demand (reboot after doing so) and running whatever application you want to use the dGPU in prime_offload mode. Like so  on the command line:  __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia [command_name].  An example: to run steam on the dGPU  simply paste '__NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD=1 __GLX_VENDOR_LIBRARY_NAME=nvidia steam' into the command line. Now any games you launch from steam will use the dGPU. You can watch the gpu load increase with 'nvidia-smi dmon'.  Likewise I can launch CAD applications in the same way  I actually created some aliases that allow me to start the relatively few applications I want to run on the dGPU using the above command  and it works great.  The dGPU is idling at minimum power state when web browsing and watching youtube on a 2048x1440 external monitor - drawing *almost* no additional power over the on-demand totally idle state (with the external monitor connected  nvidia-smi reports 18-19W usage  temp around 55c. I have seen the power usage as low as 14w when nothing is happening after boot  however  but it seems to climb up to 18W after a bit and sit there).  Big issue with just the aforementioned setup was that I was getting terrible screen tearing everywhere - whether running steam or chrome or whatever - just hideous. I tried a bunch of xorg config files to eliminate screen tearing by changing intel driver settings  all I accomplished was breaking things. To be clear  on my setup at the moment  I have *no* special xorg config - everything is out-of-the-box fresh ubuntu + i3wm + nvidia driver install. I think part of the issue is I spent a ton of time trying to figure out how to get PRIME Synchronisation working  which is completely *not* what I want. Eventually I found a buried forum post where someone mentioned that prime sync and prime offloading really have nothing to do with each other  and for solving screen tearing when using prime offloading (i.e. __NV_PRIME_RENDER_OFFLOAD) encouraged someone else to look into their display compositor.  Anyway  in my i3 config file  I have a line that used to say 'exec --no-startup-id compton' and now says 'exec --no-startup-id compton --backend glx --paint-on-overlay --vsync opengl-swc'. After a reboot  screen tearing is completely gone everywhere.  This is great  because now I can run the laptop in on-demand mode and get less terrible battery life (around 7 hours  at least according to power meter  haven't run it that long yet. Previous estimate was ~3.5hrs in Nvidia only mode  which was fairly accurate). When I want to start an application that runs on the Nvidia GPU  I can  as mentioned above. Power draw with an external monitor seems very reasonable  basically everything seems to be working as it should (except the touch-pad after sleep  forcing me to get better with the nubbin).  Hopefully for people running ubuntu this can save you some headaches.,neutral,2021-12-17
Can older gen thinkpads handle modern computer applications without modifications? Questions from a regular joe that know very little about tech.,I’m in the market for a new laptop and I’m looking for advice on which one to get. I’ve read that newer thinkpads are lower in quality compared to earlier iterations. See this post: https://reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qdg6gz/the_state_of_lenovo_thinkpad_in_2021_the_good_the/  I’m not great with tech  so I don’t want to have to swap out parts to get a functioning laptop.   Primarily I want to use this computer for word processing and internet browsing  although I would also like to be able to edit videos and use applications like photoshop. It would be a great bonus if it could run a game like Sims 4  but that would not be a dealbreaker. I also need decent storage space as I’d like to keep backups of photos and videos from my phone on the laptop. And I’d need it to have a USB and HDMI port at least. Any screen size between 13 a 15 inches would probably be about right for me. I also saw this post about screen quality but I’m not sure how to find information about this on eBay listings: https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/gec7x9/this_is_why_you_always_take_the_ips_screen_option/  I would like a used laptop  but I do have some concerns about buying one because I don’t know what red flags to look for. Any advice on that front would be appreciated.   I’m also wondering about the longevity of an older model laptop. Could anyone tell me about the trade off between the better quality build of older models and the ability to keep up with modern computing? Is there something straightforward and inexpensive I could do with an older machine to get the best of both worlds  like buy a new piece of hardware and bring it to a technician to have it installed?

Trouble with Lenovo-Support,Bad story with the support for my tp480s. I contacted the support 2 weeks ago because of some red dots that appear from time to time on the screen after the tp wakes up from hibernate. The on-site support said  they wanted to change the mainboard.   That's what they did: the inserted a mainboard that started to smoke after 30 minutes working. The support installed my old mainboard again (still willing to change it later).   Some days later the support showed up again and installed another mainboard. And it turned out that the audio-card no longer worked. The support sent and installed a new audiocard some days later that still did not work. So  I contacted again the support. This time they told me  they cannot do any on-site support any longer and I have to send-in my machine.  Seriously? The support crashed my machine and finally they want me to send the machine? What's the point of this expensive on-site support if they only install not-working or half-working hardware?,neutral,2021-12-15

Trackpoint on E570 constantly drifting and changing direction,So I have a Thinkpad E570  about three years old  that's always worked fine for me other than having to replace the keyboard about nine months ago.  In the last couple weeks though  the Trackpoint calibration has gone nuts. It will spontaneously recalibrate while I'm actively using the mouse  essentially grabbing my cursor and pushing it off the screen  forcing me to stop work and wait until it recalibrates again before I can move it. Sometimes it does this after only a split second of my using the mouse. Sometimes it's a little bit of drift  sometimes the cursor is flying off the screen.  I haven't changed any settings on the device lately  installed any new drivers  etc. It came straight out of the blue.  Has anyone else encountered this  and if so  how do I correct it?,positive,2021-12-16
Setting TLP charge thresholds does not survive reboot,This [section](https://linrunner.de/tlp/faq/battery.html#do-charge-thresholds-work-even-when-tlp-is-not-running-or-the-laptop-is-powered-off) of the tlp doc made me believe the charging threshold were saved in flash  and would survive a reboot:  \&gt; Do charge thresholds work even when TLP is not running or the laptop is powered off?  \&gt; Yes. The charging process is not controlled by software running on behalf of the operating system but by the embedded controller (EC). TLP only passes the threshold values to the EC firmware using the appropriate driver. Once stored in the EC  the thresholds also take effect when the laptop is switched off. See below for removal.  Also higher up in the doc:  \&gt; Battery charging is a process controlled by the embedded controller (EC) of your laptop. This makes the process work even when the laptop is switched off or no operating system is running  But I've experienced several times that my thresholds got reset to default 98-100.  Do I misunderstand how this works  or is there something else that might be wrong? It \_might\_ be so that this only happened when my battery got empty.,negative,2021-12-16

GPT is bad for the thinkpad p50?,Hello  a few months ago I tried to change my operating system on my computer  I use the thinkpad p50  and I added a solid state disk a m2 nvme of a terabyte  I broke it down still technical and at the end he told me that this solid state disk serves better as a slave and GPT I pass it to MBR  I want to change my operating system again  (now I know how to change)  and I want to use uefi instead of MBR and that disk is the disk that store the system  But I don't know if something will happen to the computer if I do that.   I don't know if anyone can help me or say what I can do.   I want to move on to Linux  arch Linux  I saw that the computer is Linux compatible  it even has its own page for thinkpad p50.,positive,2021-12-15
T14s (AMD) Buying advice,I’m thinking of retiring my T440p in the near future  and was torn between a used Thinkpad (T495 or similar)  a new M1 Macbook Air or keeping my T440p. I came across a deal on a T14s on Lenovo’s website starting at 800€. I would use it for college classes  running VMs and media consumption.   Fully speccing it up  it would run me about 1100€ : -Ryzen 7 4750U -32GB of RAM -512GB SSD -400 nits low powered panel -WWAN card  I was initially thinking on going R5/16GB but for 100€ the upgrade seems worth it and will future proof it.   Is this a good deal? Should I wait for the Europe release of the T14s Gen2a to get a better deal? I’m also quite concerned about the T14s running hot with the AMD chips and would love to have some feedback.,negative,2021-12-17

Thinkpad Universal Thunderbolt 4 dock and Thinkpad T490 compatibility.,Hi   I have a Thinkpad T490 and 3 1080p monitors I want to hook up to it. I've been looking at docking stations for this  and it seems that the Thinkpad Universal Thunderbolt 3 (gen 2) dock  which officially supports the T490  meets my demand of hooking up 3 external monitors.

T480 poor battery life with Ubuntu 20.04,Hello  dear community   I recently purchased my very first ThinkPad: T480 Intel 8th gen Quad-Core i5-8250U  RAM DDR4 16 Go  Toshiba 256 Go PCIe NVMe 2242 M.2 SSD.  As I was coming from 10 years using Mac OS  I figured Ubuntu would be a smoother transition (I don't really love Windows).  Now  it is probably time to mention that I am a real Linux newbie  so I might not know important things about it. Still  I managed to install it properly (Ubuntu 20.04).  I followed the advice I read in this subreddit and installed TLP and Powertop with the Terminal (first time using the terminal  that was actually fun to do  felt like I was almost knowing what I was doing... almost).  Still  the battery life on my device is not as tough as I was expecting it to be (around 2:30 to 3:00 of web browsing).   Also  when my device is plugged into AC and fully charged (100% on the top bar)  as soon as I unplug it  it falls directly to 87%  is there a reason for that?  Are there some things I can do to improve battery life?  Thanks a bunch for your precious help.,negative,2021-12-16

Questions about Thinkbook 13s-IWL PCIe  PSREF,"I bought my son a Thinkbook 13s-IWL  a handy little model with a decent chassis and screen plus upgradeable RAM  to get him through high school after his X250 developed a cracked motherboard.   The 13s came with a 256GB M.2 2242 (half-length) drive. I will be upgrading this to a 970 Evo Plus partly for larger capacity  and he will use the original device for backups in an enclosure.   Looking at the [**PSREF for the Thinkbook 13s-IWL**](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkBook/ThinkBook_13s_IWL/ThinkBook_13s_IWL_Spec.PDF)  I came away a bit confused by the ""configurable by model"" language in the storage section on two details:  1. Is the specific model I bought limited to PCIE x2  or will the new drive run at full speed?  2. Is there a possibility of adding a second drive because of the Optane support  and if so are there any caveats (maximum size  etc.)?

X13 Gen 2 AMD Impressions (spoiler: returned),"Hi all   Just want to share some of my impressions on the X13 Gen 2 AMD. I received my second unit yesterday (the first one has dead pixels  so it went back). The model is 20XH005JUS  which basically has 5850U  32G RAM  1TB PM981a  and a 2K screen panel (WQXGA). I will share my impressions in different aspects.  Build quality: Generally good. It feels nice  and the new case material (which is kind of grey) is more fingerprint-proof. The lid is well aligned with the body  and the screen panel is aligned with the bezels. The trackpad  however  has a large gap on its left. That can be aligned later according to the manual though.  Screen: Awesome. I got the AUO panel. It's bright and color is rich. I'm not sure about its response time (looks good to me). And it looks flicker-free (not confirmed).  Audio: Average. No bass  but very clear.  CPU: I only ran GeekBench 5 twice. Under windows it got around 1400 single core and 6400 multi core. Under Linux  it got 6600. Marginal difference  though  and the score is pretty awesome for such a small chassis.  RAM: 4x 8GB LPDDR4 chip by micron  seems to be the one used in raspberry pi 4 (its density is very high). 4 rounds of Memtest86 shows no error  good.  GPU: Not intensively tested  but good enough for all daily GPU-accelerated works and driving an external UHD monitor.  Thermal: Kinda ok. The bott gets warm. Fan spins at 3000 RPM max  and CPU tops at 70 Celsius. This result is under Linux kernel 5.15. I think the performance profile is really conservative. I tried to change the platform profile to ""performance"" through tlp on Linux  but doesn't work. Stress test on CPU can only make all cores run at 2.4GHz maybe. I feel that the temperature limit is strict. Not sure if this is a firmware issue or a kernel issue. This is not tested under Windows.  ---  Why I returned it?  One reason is the current performance limitation - which doesn't work for me. It looks too strict.  Another major issue is the unit has horrible coil whine. I only have heard louder coil whine in XPS 13. The cause of coil whine in X13 might be some capacitors on CPU power circuit. The whining noise is clearly related to CPU frequency boost  because when I scroll on a webpage  it whines. I thought it is acceptable  but when I was using the machine last night  it is too audible.  Another concern  though not verified by me  is the battery drain under Linux S3 sleep. It seems that this is still a problem in Gen 2.  Just some of my opinions. Thanks.",positive,2021-12-17

Crappy battery on E595(3500U) on Ubuntu 21.10 compared to Windows,"Heyo  I recently switched over from Windows 10 Pro to Ubuntu 21.10. Things are a bit rough  but workable after I used a clean install.  But battery life  regardless of installation method  seems pretty f##ked. It lasts about as long as it takes to charge it back up. X to charge  X to discharge. Maybe even a little faster  all I know is that it certainly feels like it's blasting through it quicker than Windows.  I have enabled TLP  which doesn't really... seem to do anything for me  even though it runs at boot.  My CPU  despite maybe being at 1-5% in idle/light-usage contexts  somehow floats between 50-60 deg C  and when playing 1080p YouTube or certain other slightly more intensive contexts  floats to about 70+. Fans constantly kicking in at 4300+ RPM  but not really helping much.  Granted  the E595 hasn't got a huge battery anyway  but is there anyway to make this like... more usable? The battery life on Ubuntu with this thing is pretty crappy  which is a bit annoying given Linux is meant to be ""lighter"".  I also have PowerTOP installed  but for analytics  it isn't configured to auto-tune or run as a system service  given I feel it would probably conflict with TLP. All states in ""Tunables"" read ""Bad"".  Please keep in mind that I although I am a fairly technical-minded user with years of experiences of general tech and Windows  I'm really new to Linux  so I don't quite understand how 100% of all of this works.",positive,2021-12-15

Just repasted my t470s,Hello there !  &amp;#x200B;  I have a t470s since Feb 09  2018. This is my first ThinkPad and I installed Gentoo on it  using it on heavy machine/deep learning stuff since then. And of course the occasional Diablo 2  thanks to wine.     It's a cool laptop (no pun intended)  but since a month or two it started halting itself when I upgraded Gentoo.

Am I overthinking about the panel lottery?,I've been interested in buying a new ThinkPad but have had trouble finding the right one because of the make of the screen installed on them. I've been reading that there is a panel lottery going on with the X1 Carbon and T14/P14s Thinkpads. Apparently  people are saying that the ones with the Innolux screens are the best ones with no ghosting  but it's been hard to find a Thinkpad with an Innolux screen online that has all the other specs I want. AUO panels seem to be the most common.

Quick T460S Update and Thoughts,So I've been using my newly purchased T460S for a a few weeks now and I've come to some nascent conclusions that I had perhaps failed to see when I first dove in.    My first major issue with the computer was the trackpoint  I just simply could not get it to work well for me.  After trying different distros and reading many different thoughts and opinions here on r/thinkpad and elsewhere I've found a solution that works for me and I'm content with it.  I have taken my ssd and put it on my parent's T430 and I'm still convinced the trackpoint on that computer is better.  I have tempered my expectations with the trackpoint a bit and I've learned how to work around what are my  subjective  opinions on it.  I'm content with how I have gotten it to work on the T460S with the latest Linux distros I've put on it.  Also  thanks to suggestions found here  I have improved the battery efficiency quite significantly.  However  I still think I'm going to purchase two new batteries just to make it even better.    Looking forward to using this computer and sharing with it my travels.,positive,2021-12-17

How can you know if your BIOS has a whitelist?,TLDR: I have a T540p. I want to know if there is a way to know from the system or the BIOS if the BIOS has a whitelist. - - - - - I have a T540p and was considering using an EXP GDC adapter to connect an eGPU. my laptop unfortunately does not have an ExpressCard slot  so I have to connect the EXP GDC adapter to the PCIe slot housing the WiFi card. (the 42mm M.2 LTE slot is vacant but I don't know if it can do the trick so I don't need to remove the WiFi card!) Before I go ahead with the project and purchase the parts  I would like to make sure BIOS does not have a whitelist because if it does  then a lot more effort is required for this project and I would have to think again if it is worth it for me. Most suggestions around the internet are all about replacing the WiFi card with another one from a different laptop and see what happens which is great but I don't have n extra WiFi card lying around. So  I was wondering if there is a way to know for sure from inside the system/BIOS without using extra parts.,negative,2021-12-15

About to order the 14s to replace 'modded' X230.,"Hello fellow thinkpaders.  I need to replace my ""modded"" X230  keyboard and battery  after getting and OEM keyboard for 70€ that was exactly the same as chinese one  but would have a defective key... I started looking at new laptops.  The CPU on my X230 is sadly showing is age (I need 3 VMs mostly Linux but could be 3 Windows in case I create a little ActiveDirectory).  I could do that using AWS or DigitalOcean but I need a connection and it'll cost me money. So I don't know what's the best deal getting a new 1k laptop  or spending 20€ on new keyboard and 140€ on decent 9 cell *real* battery.  Anyway my budget is around 1000€. Could be stretched to 1200€ but no more. * I do not need an OS. * I have a spare 256G SSD but isn't M.2 (Kingston SA400S37) * I would really like if the PC had a docking station (which the both T14 do).  I made a configuration of the 14s for 1100 including their uber-warranty (if you drop it or spill something). I was able to: * remove the OS   * choose the nice screen (the one with more nits)  * choose the 512G M.2 (don't need more for now)   * choose 16G ram  * choose the extra nice 3 years spill/drop warranty. * but there's something: it looks like the 3 cell battery is soldered. For the grand total of 1007€.  If I want upgradable RAM I understand I need T14 (not s version) or P14  right ? What about the M.2 SSD  will I be able to upgrade it ?  Had it not soldered RAM it would be deal of the year  for 1k  but soldered ram plus 3 cell battery makes me wonder.. what's your take fellow thinkpad users ?  Delivery is more than 6 weeks at the time of writing this.. don't want to wait for something that'll disappoint me.  Thanks !",neutral,2021-12-15

Used T560- Installing a WWAN Module and a Backlit Keyboard.,"I am planning to buy this Used Thinkpad T560 which I found online and am mainly going to use for experimenting and learning purposes. It ships with a 6300U Core i5 clocked at 2.4 Ghz and 4GB of RAM. The keyboard isn't backlit.  I am an EE student and need a second Laptop for learning GNU/Linux in depth  emacs as well as Python Programming. I maybe install Debian on it later.   My planned upgrades are the following:     * A new SSD for replacement of the built-in HDD. These used systems usually come with old Hard Drives worth replacing. Since I am using this for mainly GNU/Linux learning  I don't need a fancy SSD  I will stick to something accessible  so I am planning to buy this 512 GB Walram 2.5"" SSD for about $55: [aliexpi.com/OZV2](https://aliexpi.com/OZV2) * New memory config (16GB as 2x 8GB DDR3L 1.35V 1600Mhz). I have read somewhere that this particular Model can take up to 32GB but I don't think I will need that much since I am neither a gamer nor someone who uses heavy rendering Softwares such as Blender. I am planning to buy these Walram sticks off Aliexpress for about $60: [aliexpi.com/Lr9C](https://aliexpi.com/Lr9C) * The expernal Battery replacement with a 72Wh new one. This is gonna cost around $50:[aliexpi.com/6Wsz](https://aliexpi.com/6Wsz) * The internal Battery replacement with a 44Wh one. I plan to buy the internal from the same seller as the external battery as well. This is going to cost me another $90: [aliexpi.com/21rF](https://aliexpi.com/21rF) * A new keyboard. I will opt for a backlit US keyboard. I found one here for $40: [aliexpi.com/CCby](https://aliexpi.com/CCby) * A WWAN module. This is basically going to be my first laptop with a WWAN feature. I mostly used WiFi. I have found this piece on ebay: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/264663620173](https://www.ebay.com/itm/264663620173)  &amp;#x200B;  Now here are my questions. I have no problems with the upgrades except for the last two on the bulleted list above: the Backlit Keyboard and the WWAN module.  1. **Can I replace the non-backlit Keyboard with a Backlit one for this particular model?** The item doesn't have a backlit keyboard to begin with.

Can I install the WWAN Module as I intend to?** On the Ebay WWAN Module above  I have found that is supports and is compatible with **Thinkpad T560 (Machine type 20FH and 20FJ )** After looking at some of the pictures  I found the BIOS screen of the machine looks like this. It shows that the Machine Type Model is 20FJ S3B100. I presume that this is 20FJ machine then but I still don't know if I would be able to use a WWAN module with it.

I found at Page 124 that there is supposed be this micro-SIM slot behind the Hot-swappable battery. Is this an optional thing or does it come with all models? (at least with the 20FJ and 20FH types?)  &amp;#x200B;  [Manual Pages about SIM Card](https://preview.redd.it/wkl0ne3gti181.png?width=523&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6524856ae4e3383fd4a12615b4c88e2b44700189)  That being said  I really would like to get some help if anyone has ever owned this model and can tell me whether I can make my planned upgrades.  Also  I found on the WWAN Module on Ebay that it supports GNSS/GPS/A-GPS features. Like how is that going to help me? Are these geolocalization features helpful in some cases?  Last but not least  since I am going to use this Laptop for learning purposes as much as possible  I would also like to install Coreboot on it in order to remove Intel's Prying eyes on my daily life. Is the motherboard of this Model supported by Coreboot as of now and can I disable the IME for this?  Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance for the replies.",positive,2021-12-15

T14s Gen1 bottom cover vibrating and clacking (not flush),Hi   As the title says  the bottom cover on my T14s Gen1 (AMD) has a disturbing/distracting but not deal-breaker issue. The bottom cover isn't sitting flush with the palm-rest on the front of the laptop (the track-pad side)  it is correctly mounted  but as there are tabs instead of screws on this side  used as a kind of hinge when remounting the laptop  it has a small movement range  so typing sometimes produces some annoying vibrating noises and clacks in this area of the laptop  unless I put my wrist on this part to push it downwards.  I cannot tighten the screws as they are already fully screwed.  Also there is a loud clack produced when the area with the right USB port is pinched  which is kind of annoying but still better than a vibrating laptop when typing.  How to make the bottom cover sit flush with the palm rest without tightening more the screws?  Thanks   PS: Idk if I'm clear enough  trying to describe such a specific issue in a non-native language is kinda hard. Feel free to ask questions.,positive,2021-12-17

Picked up a T15g Gen2,Replacing a Legion C730 desktop with this (Legion will be for sale shortly if anyone is interested). Love the Legion but found myself using my old T460s the majority of the time. Plus  I’ve drooled over this model since Gen1.   Happened to check Lenovo’s site last week and no way  these were in stock. Pulled the trigger ASAP.   There’s a few great reviews out there (codeHusky and 5after12) that swayed me  but putting my thoughts here real quick.   Pics compared to T460s: [pics](https://imgur.com/a/Zmh5CHz)  Specs: i7-11800H 32GB RAM (upgraded to 64GB 16x4 before the first boot) 1TB NVMe Gen4  GTX 3070 Max-Q 500 nit FHD panel No WWAN  Initial thoughts? Quality. Beefy. Solid.   It is on the heavy side  but it is a tank. Build quality is superb. Keyboard has lots of nice travel  although coming from the T460s  it seems slightly less. More clicky.   Speakers are just fine. They lack a little richness/deepness but they get sufficiently loud and clear at least for voices.   Screen might be subjective  but I’m coming from a 250 nit panel  so it’s breathtaking to my eyes lol. Good viewing angles  almost no bleed.   CPU is just right. I’ve seen the i9 models thermal throttle  so that’s why I got the i7 for this chassis. It smokes the i7-9700k at least in artificial benchmarks. I don’t have a real bench at the moment.   Graphics are also more than enough. I threw a few decent games at it with no issues. 90-110fps on Witcher 3 at FHD Ultra + HairWorks. The fans run at 40-45db (pretty quiet  small whooshing). Bottom gets pretty warm. Also changed the BIOS to discrete mode.   I do have a small issue with the front left corner of the unit  it isn’t totally flat on the table by a tiny bit. So it bumps when laying your wrists on the rest. Maybe I’ll play around with screw tension unless anyone has an idea.,neutral,2021-12-16

Is my beloved souped up T420 finally dying? Will boot up for 1-2 minutes then automatically shut down.,Hi everyone:  Loved this LilArooni for the last 10 years.  Put a 500gb samsung ssd in it and upgraded to an intel quad core processor and threw 12gb of ram into it.  Symptoms:  * Yesterday it had this issue where while plugged in  powered off  the power light would just flash green and wouldn't boot * Also had an issue where the green power light (powered off) would sort of be on constantly and flicker a bit if that makes sense rhythmically?    What I've tried:  * Unplugged power adapter and battery  and held down the power button for 30 seconds * Took off keyboard  removed connection to the CMOS battery to the motherboard  booted it  then reset clock time * Verified that the fan does spin upon startup * Saw that the bios date is 06/04/2018   What it's doing today:  * Boots for a minute  asks me the unlock password to decrypt ubuntu 20.04; lasts for another minute or two  then shuts down unceremoniously.     Ideas?  Is this something I can fix myself  or does it sound like a motherboard issue?  I appreciate any insight and guidance. I'm also available to chat on the Thinkpad discord  and asked a similar question in #serious-questions (hopefully that was the right place).,negative,2021-12-17

T450s upgrade recommendation,"I've been using a T450s for almost 6 years now and looking to upgrade as it starts to feel a bit slow at times. I'm using it mainly for business/office/browsing and occasionally I'm running a couple VMs as well. Portability is not a big concern  I hardly ever use it on the go. Most of the time I use it as a desktop replacement connected to 2 external 23"" 1080p monitors (using all 3 displays). But I do take it with me when I travel  say a few times a year.   I have been reading good things about AMD CPUs in terms of performance/power efficiency and so the T14 AMD seemed a good option. Then I noticed the E and L series. I definitely want a thinkpad because of the trackpoint and the overall build quality  but it doesn't have to be the T series. Are E/L perceived to be decent?   Also  I was considering getting a larger size laptop  so that the screen doesn't feel tiny compared to the external ones. But then I am not a big fan of having the trackpad off center  which leaves very few choices  one of which being the X1 extreme. There are two concerns with that  one being price as I was aiming at around $1k  the other being the higher screen resolution. I am ambivalent about that. If I was using the laptop without external monitors  I would probably think it would be nice. I would have to use custom scaling of course  but overall it would probably be nice. But then I'm not sure how it would play nice with the other two screens having larger physical size and lower resolution. Custom scaling per app would probably not work  right?  Speaking of screen  my T450s has touchscreen. I have not used it that much tbh  but I'm hesitant to lose it as it might come in handy or certain apps in the future.   Finally  I do care about upgradability (for RAM and SSD  which are the components I have changed in previous thinkpads) more than being slim and light.  Any thoughts/suggestions welcome.",neutral,2021-12-16

Throubleshooting a WiFi slowdown,I daily drive two thinkpads. The first is my personal X1 Yoga Gen 3 and the second is my brand new X1 Carbon Gen 9. Running Lenovo Vantage on each to keep drivers up to date. The Yoga is running Windows 11 and the Carbon is running Windows 10.  I'm seeing a frequent issue on the Yoga where sometimes the Wifi slows down to a crawl (like &lt;20mbps) usually when resuming from sleep or undocking from one of my USB-C Universal docks. In every case turning the Wifi off  waiting a little bit  and turning it back on corrects the issue for a time.  On the X1 Carbon I'm seeing a slightly more severe issue with wifi that only affects upload speeds. The download speed is always fine but uploads are &lt;1mbps. The problem is constant and I haven't yet found a solution to it. We've deployed a dozen of these at work and the problem is affecting all of them  both on the corporate network and on my home networks. Most users are plugged in most of that day so it hasn't been an issue yet  but if we continue to buy them we will need to find a fix.  In both cases I've tried multiple versions of the adapter drivers and checked that all other chipset drivers and such are up to date. I've also tested on multiple Wifi networks and tried to replicate the problem on other devices in my house and though all of this I've seen no change. If anyone has seen this or could shed some light on what might help  I would be very grateful.  Thanks in advance.,neutral,2021-12-17

Glass and IPS screens are also high on the list naturally. Since I'm going to be working in the field im looking for something small and durable - hence the 13"" requirement and desire for an aluminum frame.  As far as specs go I think I prefer a 16GB/i5 setup over an 8GB/i7 setup. AMD I assume isn't an option since I don't see it come up with the models I found.  Can you recommend any models?  I've come up with the x380 and the x13 but have no idea what the exact difference is between the series  so maybe you could help?  Also what are the differences between generations of the x13 and how do they relate to price?  Welcome to all suggestions! Thanks",negative,2021-12-17

Best refurbished ThinkPad for CS student,Hi! I'm currently a CS student and due to Teams classes being over here  I finally need to get something portable to take with me to the class. ThinkPad looks like a rather safe choice there  but there is just a lot of different models and it's hard to pick one.    Most important things to me are:     1. Not over the budget - money is tight  I would like if it wasn't more expensive than $200/180 Euro 2. Run smoothly - I know I shouldn't expect too much considering my budget  but still would be nice if it could run Internet browser/PDF files + text/code editor without lagging 3. Refurbished - I'm perfectly fine with them being second-hand  I just need something that won't fail me in need. 4. OS - doesn't really matter that much  probably will be running some lightweight Linux distro 5. Lifetime - ThinkPads are well known for that  but longer it lives  happier I will be  I think that's all of the important details. I would love to hear your thoughts.,positive,2021-12-17

Help reviving a ThinkPad Yoga 260,So a while back I was given a Yoga 260 that I was told had liquid damage. They sent it to Lenovo as it was only a few months old at the time  but Lenovo said the motherboard was shot and needed replacement which would have cost about half the price of the original purchase. So instead  they opted to buy a new Yoga and gave me the old one. I did some preliminary testing  and there were absolutely no signs of life  so figured I could eventually use it for parts if nothing else. Took it home and put it in my pile.  Fast forward a few years  and I finally decided to give it a good look last week. I pulled the board out of the chassis to inspect it  and found very little visible damage. All in all  there was a tantalum SMD capacitor that had blown out  and a slightly corroded ceramic SMD capacitor on the same circuit further down the line. No other signs of damage.  The tantalum that had failed was a 6.3 volt 220 microfarad in a B size package. I couldn't find this value in B size at my local electronics supply shop  so I opted for the closest I could get which is a D package 10 volt 220 microfarad. I got creative with mounting it to the much smaller pads and successfully attached it to the main board. After cleaning the corrosion from the ceramic cap down the line  I tested the circuit and didn't see any further signs of a short circuit. Every fuse I could find on the board checks out okay.  I put the board back in the chassis  installed a stick of DDR4 and an M.2 NVMe (I believe it originally came with a M.2 SATA  just for info.) and applied power. Lo and behold  the system powered up  but wouldn't POST. I fiddled with it a bit longer with no success before trying a different RAM module. After putting in a 2 133 MHz module in place of te 2 400 module I put in first  the damn thing actually posted and tried to boot. While sitting for years with the fault  it completely drained the main battery pack and it would no longer take a charge. No surprise there. It also completely drained the clock battery and wouldn't hold time after removing power  but a quick battery swap there fixed that issue.  Windows installed fine  but very slowly. It took at least an hour to install Windows and complete initial Windows setup on first login. As soon as I got to the desktop  I opened Task Manager and observed that the CPU was stuck at 390 Mz and 15% load  and that's where I'm stuck at now.  I have installed all pending Windows software and driver updates  all updated from Lenovo including the latest BIOS update  have tried disabling CPU speed control in BIOS to prevent throttling  and even set Windows power plan for 100% minimum CPU usage.  I installed a new battery pack this morning. The charge indicator now comes on when plugged in  Windows sees the battery  the computer will boot and run on the battery  and Windows reports the battery is charging. It is not charging though  and the percentage is slowly dropping when plugged in.  At this point  it seems there is a deeper issue on a hardware level  but I'm hoping someone might have an idea of what to try next.,neutral,2021-12-16

USB-C Power Supply for Lenovo ThinkPad P15v Gen 1,I originally posted this over on r/UsbCHardware and someone suggested posting here as well  hope no one minds.  I was wondering if anyone knows of a USB-C power supply that would charge my ThinkPad  P15v Gen 1 - or even if it \_will\_ charge via USB-C?!  I bought it intending to use a USB-C charger with it  but didn't read the specs carefully enough!  It comes with a 135W brick  and I think I read somewhere USB-C is limited to 100W?  AIUI  I only need the full 135W when I'm using it full blast (including I  would imagine the built-in NVIDIA GPU)  but is that realistic?  What options - if any - do I have?  It was suggested to use one of these [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLDQC5C/](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GLDQC5C/) to allow an 100W supply to plug into the 'slim tip' power adaptor.,neutral,2021-12-17

Upgrading from my T430.

I haven't really kept up with new thinkpads since I wasn't in the market  but now that I'm looking it seems like even T and E series models are all thin and sleek but they look like everything is probably all soldered in there and not very repairable  which is *primarily* what I'm looking for in a replacement other than a better processor than the t430 and a usb-c port or 2. Are the new ones still worth looking in to or should I aim for a few years ago?   My budget tops out at about $1500 if that helps out any.,positive,2021-12-15

Considering upgrade to X1E G4  need advice,"Hi  I'm a long time ThinkPad user (\~20yrs now)  I currently have a T480s 16GB RAM/512 M2 with a Thunderbolt 3 dock station  ThinkVision monitor  and such.  I'm considering upgrading my T480s  which I use mostly for development  and occasionally to edit some amateur drone footage.

The only thing that is keeping me on the edge  is the fact that the X1E comes with a very large power adapter (135W?) and Lenovo's ""square"" connector (the same I have in my dock stations)  and I'm really used to having a single connector for al my devices (and these of my wife)  not only the dock stations but also the ""spare"" AC adapters we take out.  So long story short  can I use the Thunderbolt 3 Dock USB power delivery to use my laptop regularly  and only plug the heavy AC adaptor when doing intensive work  or I will have to suck it up and carry (and plug) the square connector everywhere I go?

Thinkpad P1 Gen 4 32GB/1TB/3070 mini review  it's good,"Got my P1G4 (**20Y30066US**) a few days now  some general thoughts to share:  * Size and weight. Noticeably heavier than my X1E Gen 2. Slightly larger  noticeably thicker. I don't mind the size/weight increasing considering we got RTX3070 in it. However  the 230W power brick is seriously huge  more than twice the size and weight of my old 135W charger.    * By the way I plugged in the 135W charger  it actually works fine even during gaming. I just get a ""slow charging"" warning from Windows. * Screen. I love the 16:10 1600P screen. Previously had the 500nits 4K  now with this 400nits 1600P screen I don't feel like I am missing anything. I don't feel the need to get the 4K+ screen on P1G4. No dead/stuck pixel found. Very little light bleeding at bottom corners in completely dark room. * Performance. I haven't run any benchmarks. I just load the apps I typically use and see how it goes. Cyberpunk 2077 runs fine at 1440P with medium/high settings and DLSS set to performance. I couldn't get the GeForce Experience overlay to work  therefore cannot see FPS counter. My eyes tell me is about 60FPS in most cases.  Other games such as Age of Empires IV also run fine. * Ram. Another post mentioned they got 32GB ram in single channel. I checked mine. Really there is only one 32GB stick. I thought for 32GB Lenovo would put in 2X16GB. But no  they want us to upgrade to 64GB. I guess I have no choice but ordering another 32GB stick. Hopefully that will increase gaming performance by enabling dual channel. * SSD. It is the commercial version of Samsung 980 PRO  ridiculously fast. Apps such Office and Photoshop  load time is cut in half comparing to for example Samsung 970 EVO. However  games don't always benefit as much. I see no loading time difference in Age of Empires IV. * Keyboard  trackpad  speakers. I don't know what to think of this flat keyboard. Still better than most other brands  but I like the old keyboard better. Trackpad has a tiny bit of rattling when I touch the bottom edge. I don't use it much. Probably will not go through replacement just for that. Speakers are greatly improved  still not as good as Macbook Pro 15 inch from a few years ago. * Heat and noise. When doing light tasks  it is close to silent and cool to the touch. When doing demanding tasks  the area above keyboard is hot  unpleasant to touch. Keyboard is just warm  still OK. The noise under heavy gaming is close to but not yet reached the lowest setting of a Dyson hair dryer. * Battery life. I haven't used it on battery often enough to tell. In my limited experience  sometimes battery display 8hr left  sometimes 3hr left. I can't tell which one is more accurate. * Fingerprint reader. I thought it is now integrated in power button  so that I just push it once and I will be logged in. But no. I push it once  it starts the login process  then the power indicator turns green  I need to then scan my fingerprint to log in. This is not an one-push process. Am I doing it wrong?  Overall  I think this is the best powerful (and best looking) PC laptop out there. For the same money I could get the Lenovo Legion 7 with similar specs and better performance. But I prefer the business look over the gamer's look.   If you have any questions regarding this model  I will see if I can answer.

Has anyone deballed a t430s CPU and put on a 3632qm or the likes? Anyone reading this into replacing soldered CPUS in gerneral?,Have a T430s I bought by mistake while browsing ebay basically asleep. T430 is my person favorite thinkpad however.   It was very cheap and needed some attention so a free return even wasn't worth the shipping price back. But it has an i5 dual core... not useful for myself. However I wouldn't mind having a T430s if it was running a low wattage quadcore Ivybridge like the i7-3632qm (or am I incorrect that the t430s uses these CPUS that T430 does?     Have an i7 3632m laying about. Low Wattage chip  should be the same as the i5 dual core on there.   Have never done this on thinkpad. I'm actually very new to thinkpads. But if it's like any other soldered CPU I feel capable of at least accomplishing that.      I'm wondering if my technique and the time spent is aside the question  is there anything that would prevent this from being a success? Has anyone done something similar?    I also don't see managing thermals to be a great obstacle (have this part thought out).  Interested to link up with other soldering hobbyists as well.,neutral,2021-12-17

Decent budget (&lt;$400) Thinkpad for (mostly) programming?,Hi all  I have a dying Macbook Pro that I want to transition away from - and it looks like a used Thinkpad running some Linux distribution would be my best bet.

ThinkPad Subreddit Spirit,So I know there was a post earlier complaining about how pictures get more attention and stuff.  I wanted to share a bit of my experience. Today I rescued an 11 year old HP laptop for a niece. They couldn't afford to buy a new one. I told him I'll fix it for you. And boy I didn't know it could be difficult. But this sub has given me the audacity and the knowledge to tinker with laptops more than ever. I upgraded the HDD to SSD but upgrading ram was a lot of problem. HP support is shit. The design is shit. The keyboard is the most tortured keyboard layout I've seen in my life. Anyway it wouldn't recognize 8gb of ram. I updated BIOS and tested a couple of windows versions. Non worked. I searched a lot and a lot and it turns out that the laptop only accepts low density rams  I had looked up frequency and timings but didn't know they have two versions so I had bought a high density version. Fortunately my own 11 year old daily driver had 8 GB low density but also supported high density. So I swapped the rams with my own and installed windows 10 which worked like a charm (no they can't and won't use Linux).  I have rescued other laptops as well  and I owe a lot of my knowledge to this sub. So cheers to all those who share knowledge that we can use to resurrect old laptops and reduce e-waste  and get children (and adults) who can't afford shiny new devices  happy.  P.S I have to move to another country soon  so I will be leaving my old daily driver and leave with my E580 (my new work has ordered a T15g Gen 2 for me). I have cleared  repaste and made the laptop ready and I plan to giving it to a school where it should hopefully serve a couple of more years.  I encourage all you collector guys to donate the ThinkPads you don't use to places where they need it (we had a genuine post about an Indian fellow who's t400 was dead and couldn't afford a new one). They are not for sitting idle. They should be used to spread knowledge and advance humanity. Thanks.,neutral,2021-12-15

Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 4 running Sway &amp; Wayland,I got a Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 4 and I am not able to get external monitors to work using Sway on Wayland. I have gone down the rabbit hole mostly trying everything attempted in this thread [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/nvidia-495-on-sway-tutorial-questions-arch-based-distros/192212).  General outcome:   \- Sway and Wayland run perfectly fine since the laptop display is powered by the iGPU   \- display ports (HDMI &amp; DisplayLink) are not recognized at all as shown by `swaymsg -t get_outputs`   \- Installing the NVidia drivers or nouveau with KMS will force you to launch sway with explicit unsupported GPU flags  Sway still runs fine at this point  display ports are recognized but all active and you cannot get the screens to activate  From what I understand Lenovo decided to hard-wire both  HDMI and DisplayLink  to the dedicated graphic cards making it impossible to to power up any external device without the need to make use of the discrete graphic cards  which since it's NVIDIA  is still utterly broken.

Can't decide which I should choose.,"Hi   I've recently started studying computer science in Germany and looking for a laptop. As I'm planning to build a pc later on  I'll use the laptop mainly for my university.  My current laptop is an Asus N550jv and it's nearly 9 years old  so I've decided to search for a laptop that should last long. While I was doing my research  thinkpads caught my eye with their long lasting components and battery life.   There is a website called ""campus point""  they make extra discounts for the students and I'm especially interested in two of the thinkpads they're selling.  First one is the E14 3.gen: -Ryzen 5 5500U  -16gb RAM -512gb SSD -14.0""  FHD  %45 NTSC  IPS Display -639€ Link: https://www.campuspoint.de/20yds00g00-lenovocampus-thinkpad-e14-g3.html  And the second one ist the E15 3.gen: -Ryzen 7 5700U -16gb RAM -512gb SSD -15.6""  FHD  %100 sRGB  %72 NTSC  IPS Display -719€ Link: https://www.campuspoint.de/20yhs00a00-lenovocampus-thinkpad-e15-g3.html  I'm leaning towards the E14 because it's 14"" so I thought that it should be more portable and it's cheaper. But CPU upgrade and the %100 sRGB display on the E15 makes me think more about the E15.  Do you guys think that E15 is worth the price difference? Or should I just go right away and buy the E14?

Help with dumb mistake I made...,I have owned ThinkPads since they were IBM ThinkPads  and I am aware the high level of security they put into the Supervisor password in the BIOS/UEFI.  However  I generally use a variation of a password that would be difficult for anyone to guess but simple for my to guess  but I found out when I set the password when I am getting ready to doze off  that does not work to well☹️  I know that it cannot be reset easily (or at all on newer ones - IDK).  I have a P15 that I set the Supervisor password on in the event it was stolen it would not be of use to anyone  and protect any data that may not be encrypted.  So  my question is  the power-on prompt limits to three passwords before it shuts down the machine  and it can be powered right back up and tried again.  There is also the Think Deploy tool that can be used to change BIOS/UEFI settings in Windows that will not limit to 3 and just notify that the password check failed  allowing you to seemingly to try as many times as needed.  What I likely did was use mixed-case in the password and am getting it incorrect  and would although I do not need it at this time  I do not want to wait until I do need to disable Secure Boot or something else and go through the process of guessing what I entered.  Does anyone know of a more efficient way for me to discover what I typed  or are the ideas above what I am should use?  And yes  I did learn not to enter a password of this level of importance so close to bedtime.  Thanks!,neutral,2021-12-17
My Candid Experience with My Recently Purchased T460s,My house is full of old slow computers and older and even slower cars so I decided to pick up something a bit more contemporary that would be useful in everyday life  nice to look at  while not being something I would simply see as another consumer appliance and all simultaneously not offend my stretched pecuniary state.  My parents have a T430 that I suggested the family get long ago and I had always wanted a ThinkPad of my own so I decided to find a refurbished one that I could be happy with.  I found a T460 pretty cheap online  read some reviews  and bought it.  It was nicely put together with a 6th gen skylake  20gb of memory  a 500gb pci ssd.  The computer that arrived was a T460s but with 10gb more memory so I decided to not send it back.  I like the diet the T460s was given in its proportions and I needed the computer last week not next month.  I installed Linux Mint Cinnamon Uma  my days of eccentric cutting-edge distros relegated to my youth  and pressed on.  I expected the T460s not to have the impressive battery life of the T460  I read so much about in reviews but I also wasn't expecting how badly the T460s haemorrhages juice from the two internal batteries.  It would probably be better using Windows but I'm not going to do that.  I really like the keyboard on the T430 my parents have and even though the keyboard on the T460s is similar it just isn't quite the same  subjectively.  I am still head-over-heels about the keyboard compared to any of its contemporary competitors  by far  but the differences are still notable between the T460s and its older  and even not so older  counterparts.   The trackpoint on the T460s is simply woeful.  I spent the better part of the day scouring the world wide web searching for elegant solutions for Linux and kind of found some that work  sometimes.  The trackpoint is not a precision instrument on this computer  it is erratic.  Maybe it would be better on Windows.  I have got it set up where it only bothers me  truly  maybe a quarter of the time.  However  I really was not expecting it to be this poor.  The trackpoint on the T430  running Linux  is no gem either but it does not share bipolar behaviour like the T460s.  The touchpad  though not quite as aggressively garbage  still feels like a breeze-block when you asked for a sheet of paper.  It often times falls asleep and becomes unresponsive when I ask it to do something.  This is charming with a dog  sometimes  but certainly not an input device.  The computer case is itself physically undamaged  from an impact perspective  but the keyboard and the palm rest of the case are quite weathered from  what I presume to be  skin oils from the previous user.  Perhaps I am wrong but the matte black has worn to a highly reflective sheen.  It isn't a big deal for me but it is interesting.    I was talking to my brother about new computers and we both agreed on the attractive presence any ThinkPad has in a room.  They have a beautiful design language that is fairly time transcendent.  We both agreed that the T460s is built physically well and had a  perhaps  above average tech specification when brand new but neither of us could foresee buying one unused for the price when better performance options exist that are better priced.  However  when I brought up the important topic  to me  that ThinkPads are easy to tear apart and work on he shrugged me off  who cares every single computer now is an electric appliance.  Perhaps he's right and I'm looking at the ThinkPad through thick rosy spectacles.    The T460s  at the price I bought it  is just what I wanted in my life right now and I'm happy with its performance and expect to use it for several more years to stream videos  write  scan old negatives and edit photographs without worrying too much that I'll drop and break it.  When I have the means to buy a brand-new flagship laptop in the future the question remains if I will go with a ThinkPad but it will certainly be an option.,neutral,2021-12-16

I am slowly leaning towards the p14s because of its great battery and price! But I dunno if the 2gb integrated graphics would be sufficient compared to the p14s Intel dedicated gpu.

X1E lemon - how to get replacement in EU?,"I bought a 3-year global warranty with my X1 Extreme Gen 1  and thank goodness I did. For the third time now  the machine has overheated and killed its own battery  this time for daring to play a single hour of Disco Elysium. Red light blinks 3 times when plugged in  battery does not charge.  Most recent service was a motherboard replacement in July to resolve this + other hardware problems.  I live in Croatia now  where local support is farmed out. They don't seem to be authorized to do anything more than endless repairs until warranty expiry.  With mine expiring in two weeks  I'm obviously concerned that not even a new motherboard has resolved this laptop's tendency to self-destruct.  Does Lenovo have a lemon policy? How many times can a machine require a major repair for the same issue before Lenovo will acknowledge they shipped a bad laptop  do the right thing  and replace it with something—anything!—that works?  Any advice or contacts would be appreciated  as I'd really prefer not to have to buy a new laptop right now. Given my relationship with Lenovo has very understandably reached the ""about to lose a customer for life"" stage  I'm really hoping they'll step up.",positive,2021-12-16

Buying Help - E15 Gen 2 vs L14?,Hi all   I am currently shopping for a laptop for a mechanical engineering major for college. I have heard the ThinkPads are excellent for engineering  so I decided to narrow one of my focuses to the ThinkPad series.

Caring for my Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 4,I just received my X1E Gen 4 and I would like to make sure it will continue to look as new as it is now.  &amp;#x200B;  1. Are there recommendations for the display? With my X1 Carbon eventually there would be slight imprints from the track point or keys.

With my older Thinkpad T and X-Series I would remove the battery when it is connected to AC to prevent the battery from being used and unnecessarily charged. Has the technology around this changed?

Linux with the X1 Carbon G9 - How’s your experience?,I’m asking because I don’t seem to be particularly lucky here. I got my first ThinkPad (X1 Carbon G9) and was really excited about it  but I’m having a very peculiar problem.  It’s running fine for some time but a few hours in I’m getting random segfaults all over the place with mostly browser tabs or whole browsers crashing. Eventually this is followed by a Kernel Panic and I have to restart the whole device.  I tried a lot of things including installing various Linux distributions (including the original Lenovo OEM)  a BIOS and EC upgrade (now at 1.49)  a memtest86 (overnight  no issues) and running the internal diagnostics (no issues). The only way I can get a sort of stable system is by disabling the CPU power management which results in cutting the battery life almost in half in my case. Also then I have to enable S3 suspend (otherwise the battery is empty after just some hours in suspend) which breaks the trackpad after suspend (a known bug).  I also tried lots of software cpu power management tools like TLP but they don’t really help with these issues.  At this point I’m pretty desperate. Are there any other X1 G9 users here running Linux successfully? Any special configurations you had to change to get there? I’d appreciate any help!,positive,2021-12-17

For example  the official website indicates the P15 Gen 2 has 3 more hours of battery life than T15g Gen 2.

My humble review of my Thinkpad X1E4,Configuration: Intel i7 11800H  RTX 3060  32GB RAM  512GB SSD  2K display  &amp;#x200B;  Before I start with my review  for those of you who don't want to read it entirely  I will briefly summarize what I like and what I don't like about this laptop.  &amp;#x200B;  **What I like**:  	Great performance  	Excellent keyboard  	Excellent build quality  	Beautiful design  	Good display and speakers  	Plenty of ports  &amp;#x200B;  **What I don't like**:  	Awful microphone quality  	Impossible to keep clean  	Thermals could be better  	My unit has a slight coil whine  &amp;#x200B;  Now  let's start with the full review.   First of all  I want to point out that I'm not a professional reviewer  so this will not be a technical analysis  I will just share with you my opinions about this laptop  which I have used for 3 weeks now. Second  I want to specify which is my typical usage. I am a PhD student in the field of Physics and Data Science  so I mostly use the laptop for coding  Machine Learning  Deep Learning and also writing reports  making presentations  and attending online meetings. Also  I am not a native English speaker  so I apologize if my writing is not perfect.  Now  without further ado  let's dive into the review.  &amp;#x200B;  **Build Quality and Design**  The build quality is excellent; this is no doubt one of the most well build laptops I have put my hands on. Every part of the laptop feels premium and really solid  and I also think it is absolutely beautiful. Unfortunately  my unit has a slight coil whine  which appears randomly. For me  this is not a big deal  and I don't think Lenovo is to blame for it  I know it just happens sometimes  but it's right to point it out.   Finally  the PC gets dirty very easily and  unless you clean it frequently  you will always see your fingerprints everywhere (I clean it each time I use it because it bothers me haha).  &amp;#x200B;  **Performance and Battery life**  Performance is amazing  the laptop is lighting fast for everything I do with it. Opening programs like MS Word or Visual Studio Code is instantaneous. I also have no problems dealing with big dataframes and launching very complex Deep Learning models.  However  heat management could be better. When running highly demanding tasks   the laptop gets hot  and the CPU lowers its frequency to keep the temperature stable. In this regard  since DL makes large use of the GPU  I found that undervolting the GPU reduces its temperature by 6/7°C  keeping it around 75°C. Also  when I train my networks  I disable the CPU boost. This substantially reduces the heat generated with an almost negligible loss of performance. As far as I know  undervolting the CPU is not possible. What concerns me is the fact that the fans rarely go full speed; the laptop tries to stay as quiet as possible. I wish it could be possible to manually control the fan speed and use them at their full potential in certain situations. By the way  when doing light work  the PC is completely silent and ice-cold   and I like it because I don't want to hear the fan noise during meetings  or touch a hot keyboard while coding.   Battery life is not bad at all  I expected worse. On average  I get between 6 and 8 hours of battery life with the display at half brightness and doing normal stuff such as coding   web browsing  and MS Office. I don't know how many hours you can get when performing heavy tasks; I never use it unplugged if I have to do intensive work.  &amp;#x200B;  **Keyboard  touchpad  and other inputs**  For me  the keyboard is an essential part of the laptop  since  as I said  I spend a lot of time writing code and reports  and the keyboard of this laptop is beautiful  I love it. It has good key travel  a nice sound  the keys are well spaced; in short  it is a very good keyboard. Same for the touchpad. In particular  I love the three physical buttons  it almost feels like having a mouse. The microphone  instead  is awful  and this is a bummer because I often attend online meetings. I tried to change some settings in the Lenovo Vantage software but it seems to not have any effect. I really can't believe they put a so crappy mic on a so well build laptop.  &amp;#x200B;  **Multimedia**  Watching a movie or listening to music with this laptop is a pleasure. The screen is bright  with a good resolution  and good colors. Moreover  I really  really love the fact that the display is matt  especially because I use dark themes when coding  and I have a window right behind my desk  so  having an unreflective screen is a game-changer for me. The speakers are excellent too; they are plenty powerful and have good audio quality. Also  they are front-facing  so you can keep the PC on your lap or on the bed without losing audio quality.  &amp;#x200B;  **Conclusions**  In general  I would recommend this laptop to everyone  especially to people with needs similar to mine. I'm liking it a lot  it is absolutely a pleasure to work with such a beautiful machine. However  I think that if you are planning to run very intensive tasks for many hours every day  maybe you need something with better cooling. Don't get me wrong  it does its job when I run my DL models  and it does it well  but usually  I run them for one or two hours in a day  and not every day  cause most of the time I spend developing those models. So  if you need to keep your PC under heavy load for many many hours every day  maybe it is better to go for one of its bigger brothers  like the p15.,neutral,2021-12-17

ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 1 Concern,"Hello!  My ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 1 has some sort of ""bubble"" or out-bowing of its chassis. In the picture  please note the curvature of the chassis toward the upper left of the touchpad. The very upper left of the touchpad actually now sticks up a bit from the chassis. Also possibly related: there is literally a screw loose. The center screw at the bottom of the chassis is loose  and I'm unable to tighten it. (It simply spins when I attempt to tighten it.)  I first noticed this bubble perhaps even a year ago now. I haven't kept track of whether it's gotten worse in that time. 90%+ of the time my ThinkPad is connected to a Thunderbolt 3 dock with two external monitors attached (so that I have three monitors in total as I work). I've never dropped or otherwise  to my knowledge  abused the machine. I also haven't ever removed the underside chassis panel to explore what might be happening  as I'm somewhat afraid that something will pop apart that I can't put back in place.  In the past year or so I've had a few cases during Zoom or Teams meetings where everything slows to a crawl and I've had to reboot. I have a Logitech Brio webcam connected to the dock that I use for these meetings. I'm not sure whether that's related to what might be happening--whether the external monitors and webcam together are overstressing something and causing a physical problem inside of my machine--but thought I'd mention it.  The machine is no longer in warranty.  Any ideas here about what might be happening and whether  practically speaking  there is anything I can or should do about it?  Thank you for any help here.

Possible bios passwords dangers?,I have a Thinkpad X1E and a Thinkstation P340.  My goal is to keep personal data safe even if either computer is stolen.  I have set a hard drive password (user and master) as well as a supervisor password in the bios.  My question is  assuming I don't forget my passwords  are there any other possible dangers?  For example  could these passwords cause complications when applying bios updates via Lenovo Vantage  or Windows updates requiring reboots?  If I know in advance that a reboot will be required  I could always temporarily remove the passwords  but is that necessary?,negative,2021-12-15

Just had a bad experience with a thinkpad,Hi. I just wanted to share something with you. Yesterday I ordered a thinkpad L490 with some good specs. i5-8250u 8G Ram full hd display and nvme storage  however  I was kinda disappointed.    My current laptop is t460 and gotta say the T series are much better than the L series.     The L490 overheated pretty quickly  something that has not happened in a very long time to me.   The speakers sounded like a cheap radio from the 70s  no bass  shallow and light crackling.   The Display was kinda meh in terms of color reproduction and brightness.   Trackpad was weird and the keyboard felt like cheap plastic.  &amp;#x200B;  For the past 5 years roughly I use ONLY thinkpads  and this was the first meh experience I ever had.     Thanks for reading my rant  hope you have a great day ahead.,negative,2021-12-15

Trustworthy T530 battery replacement,I've recently started using an older T530 for my programming classes  and because the original 6-cell battery only holds up for around 40 minutes during use I decided to order a 9-cell one online. This is the one I ordered: [https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07TJ38TNL/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o02\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07TJ38TNL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) Unfortunately a couple days ago (around 4-5 months after it arrived) it started to not be recognized by my T530 at all  as soon as I unplug the laptop it shuts down. I tried letting the battery rest outside of the laptop for a day and it's still as dead as before. I'd like to get a new 9-cell battery  but am hoping to purchase one that actually holds up for at least a year or two  since I don't want to spend 100€ a year just for new laptop batteries... I'd also like to avoid the many sketchy laptop battery websites  so preferably something from amazon. Any recommendations as to manufacturers? Is Green Cell decent?,negative,2021-12-16

4K60 on E14 Gen 2 (AMD),Hello!  I'm looking to buy a 4K60 monitor but I found out that my E14 Gen 2 only has HDMI1.4  which means it would only deliver 4K30 and not 4K60. But  I found out that my dock (ThinkPad Hybrid USB-C and USB-A dock) claims to deliver a resolution and refresh rate up to 5120\*2880@60Hz. Is that true? Would I be able to use a 4K60 monitor with my E14 Gen 2 by connecting it to the dock?   (P.S. I have my mouse  keyboard  Logitech C922 Pro webcam  Elgato HD60 capture card (USB 2.0)  headphones and an Ethernet cable connected to the dock)  Thanks! :),positive,2021-12-17

I have recently bought a T61 which turned out to be a really good laptop even today  I have a problem though: when I'm using external headphones via the front connector  I can hear through those everytime that I touch the palmrest or use the keyboard  and these sounds also interfeer with online meetings  since the interlocutor can hear those noises and basically I cannot use the laptop while speaking because my voice gets completely covered.

P1 Gen 4 / X1 Extreme Gen 4 Power Consumption in Modern Standby (S0ix),Since S3 Standby Touchpad malfunction is not gonna be fixed any soon as we still didn't hear any feedback from Lenovo yet  I have no choice but to stick with the broken Modern Standby (S0ix) and hope it could still able to achieve low power consumption during sleep.  However in my case  although the power consumption seemed not too bad (around 2W / 2% drain per hour)  but I found that the HW DRIPS states is always showing zero and I cannot find any reasons from the sleep study report.  For the BIOS version I tested with both v1.08 and also v1.11 (latest) but with no luck  also I ensure all the drivers are up to date and without any apparent abnormality.

Linux Dock no Audio trough Displayport.,I tried some configuration changes  i tried out different distros arch  Manjaro  openSUS but no one worked. I tried to change some configurations from old outdated guides and I deleted alsa configs and regenerated them.  My ThinkPad is an t440p an ultradock (these older ones without USB C) and everything works fine on Linux i am currently using Manjaro gnome but as I said it was with arch the same. So my issue is i don't get any sound from the Dockingstation Displayport. Probably would be interesting if the laptop itself gets audio from Displayport but i have no mini so cable. The headphone jack and the USB plugs work perfect but as i use my monitor for my Xbox too it's not really a solution to replace the plug every time.,negative,2021-12-16

ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 AMD: Initial initial impressions &amp; review,"   ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 AMD Review  ═════════════════════════════     Thought I’d write up my thoughts about my new X13 Gen 2 AMD.  I’ll be reviewing in the context of my other daily drivers.  I keep separate home/work setups  which have been:    Work: T480s  now P1 Gen 2.  Home: X230  X270.    The X13 is an upgrade for the home setup.  My workloads are JVM/misc programming  light video editing  photo editing  email  streaming video  etc.   Specs (as bought)  ─────────────────     • AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 5850U  8c/16t   • 32gb LPDDR4 RAM   • 256gb SSD (smallest/cheapest available)   • Realtek Wifi   • 1920x1200 display (non-touch)   • Backlit keyboard   • Debian 11 ""Bullseye""   Design &amp; Build  ──────────────     Well  it looks like a ThinkPad.  Lenovo seems to be slapping more and more garish logos on them these days  so there’s a Dolby logo on the palmrest  a shiny metal Lenovo logo on the lid  and a full machine name and info about the magnesium chassis on the bottom  for some reason.    The chassis is solid  and doesn’t flex when picked up by a corner.  The build feels much more premium than the X270.    Port selection is similar to the X270  except the slim tip charging port has been replaced with a side-docking proprietary USB-C port  and the SD card reader is gone.    Lenovo finally seems to have found a soft-touch finish that doesn’t suck.  It doesn’t collect fingerprints like some models; my P1G2 gets filthy if you look at it.  The palmrest does collect skin oil more than models with a plastic or painted finish  like the X270  T480s  etc.    The color of the body is lighter than in previous generations  and contrasts with the keyboard and trackpad  which are darker.  It’s minor  but I preferred the old monochromatic style.    It cannot be opened with one hand.   Display  ───────     I opted for the 1920x1200 ""FHD"" non-touch panel instead of a higher-resolution one.  I don’t think the denser displays make much visual difference  but they do consume more battery  so I find them a poor trade-off on a laptop.  If there was a FHD 400-nit low-power FHD option  I would have gotten that  but it’s only available in QHD.    I don’t mind 16:9  but the extra vertical space you get with the 16:10 panel is nice  as are the smaller bezels.    There is a display lottery  and I lost it.  Mine has the InfoVision M133NW4J R3  and it’s really bad.  Out of the box  it has a warm/reddish cast  though a calibrated color profile may help.  It also has a weird rastering effect  where you can see faint lines between the rows of pixels when you get moderately close to the panel.  Looking at it with a 20x loupe  it seems that the space between rows of pixels is slightly further apart than between columns.    I’ve never seen anything quite like it  even on lower-resolution 768p displays  or larger sized (but lower density) 14"" / 15"" 1080p ones.    LG and BOE make the other two FHD LCDs.  I don’t know which one is best  but I’d be very surprised if either were worse than the InfoVision.   Keyboard  ────────     There are two keyboard manufacturers this time around  Chicony and one I don’t know the proper name of; Lenovo’s code for it is PMX  which is the one I have.    The action is still good  decently tactile  but it suffers a lot due to the reduced key travel and flatter cap profile.  The keyboard also has quite a bit of flex  either when you push down or during normal typing.  It doesn’t impact my speed or accuracy  but the overall feel is very cheap compared to other ThinkPads.    Overall  it’s a big step backwards.   TrackPoint  ──────────     The TrackPoint module is made by Elan  and works fine.  I think it’s on par with the others I’ve used.    The buttons are another story  another big step backwards in the name of thinness.  The right/left buttons are completely flat  and the middle button only has a very slight raise.  They’re thin  plasticky  rattle a bit  and have a much louder click than I’ve ever heard on a ThinkPad.   Trackpad  ────────     It’s nice  it has a satin-finished glass surface.  It’s a big step up from the X270 and other models that have one with a plastic sticker for the surface.  Gestures work fine.  It’s still mechanical  with a hinge at the top  which I prefer — haptic pads just feel weird to me.    The small size of the laptop and wide trackpad mean that your hands touch it when typing more than on older models.  Palm rejection seems good  though  so this hasn’t presented a problem in practice.   WiFi  ────     The AMD models come with Realtek PCIe WiFi modules.  I immediately replaced with an Intel AX201  so I don’t have anything to say about the stock one.  I hear they suck.    The Intel models have soldered Intel WiFi modules.  I don’t think any laptop should have soldered WiFi.   Storage  ───────     I don’t have anything to say on this  since I bought the minimum storage configuration and upgraded it before I booted the machine.   Speakers  ────────     The Gen 2 model has new up-firing speakers above the keyboard  whereas previous models all had down-firing speakers near the front edge.  Firing straight up means the sound is much less muffled.    Dolby logo on the palmrest notwithstanding  they sound like ass.  Bass response is nonexistent  and they don’t get loud enough.  About the best I can say is that when cranked all the way up  they don’t distort horribly like in some models.    Just to make sure I wasn’t judging this too harshly  I played the same song the X13 and my three-year-old Pixel 3a which I bought used for $100.  The Pixel utterly destroys the X13  with a full  rich sound.   Battery life  ────────────     This laptop comes with two battery options  41wh and 54wh  though I’m not sure which configurations have what.  Mine has the 54wh  so I assume the lower-spec builds have the smaller battery.    Battery life is fine  but not amazing.  It’ll probably get you through a day without a recharge on light workloads  but if you’re using the CPU a lot  you’ll need to recharge midday.  This is about what I expected  though I certainly hoped for better.    The big ding on battery life is the drain during sleep.  I lose about 10% of the charge when it’s asleep overnight.  I know Linux is behind Windows on power management  but this is excessive and not an issue on older models.    Sleep is set to ""Linux"" in the BIOS  and I disabled the always-on USB ports.    I have no idea why the current crop of ThinkPads has regressed so much on this.   Performance  ───────────     Performance gets an unqualified thumbs up; it’s excellent  and really chews through concurrent jobs like compiling software.    From LUKS password prompt to GDM login screen is like one second.  For my workloads  it’s very capable.  It’s easily the fastest computer I own.   Thermals  ────────     Overall  good  it runs cooler than both my X270 and P1G2.  With a large compile job saturating everything and the CPU boosted up to 3.6ghz  temps hit a high of 83°.  After the fan kicks in  temps drop significantly  down to 61°.  At full load  with the fan at 3000 RPM  temps are still in the 60° range.  The fan is audible from 2600rpm on  but not overly loud.    Lenovo seems to have done a good job on the cooling system on this model.  Thumbs up.   Odds and Ends; Minor Quibbles  ─────────────────────────────     My build has no audible coil whine.    The bottom case is so thin that the botom of the LCD hits whatever surface it’s sitting on when it’s open much more than 90 degrees.    Sometimes  when the machine wakes from sleep  the display is at max brightness.  Quite an unpleasant surprise if you’re opening it during the evening or in a dimly lit room.    On other models  the charging LED by the port changes from orange (charging) to white (charged) when the battery reaches its charge threshold.  The X13 Gen 2a does not; the LED always stays orange.  I don’t know if this is an EC bug  or the LED is only single color  but I wish it worked like the older models.   Conclusion  ──────────     I love the performance  but wish they’d kept the superior keyboard of older models.  My biggest beefs are the awful display and the keyboard flex.  I could probably live with the shallow travel  but all the flex really cheapens the experience.  Lenovo really seems hell-bent on destroying the ThinkPad keyboard.    I haven’t decided whether to return or keep it.  The crappy panel and keyboard flex are the things making me consider the return.  If the panel was good and the keyboard felt less IdeaPaddy  I’d be satisfied.    Lenovo should fix their QA so that you can reliably get a good machine every time you buy a ThinkPad.  The huge variation between suppliers makes it feel like buying a 1970s American car: you just have no idea if it’s going to be good or a lemon.  Unfortunately  this has been a problem for years  and they’ve shown no inclination to addressing it.",positive,2021-12-16

If the panel was good and the keyboard felt less IdeaPaddy  I’d be satisfied.    Lenovo should fix their QA so that you can reliably get a good machine every time you buy a ThinkPad.  The huge variation between suppliers makes it feel like buying a 1970s American car: you just have no idea if it’s going to be good or a lemon.  Unfortunately  this has been a problem for years  and they’ve shown no inclination to addressing it.",negative,2021-12-17
Prevent battery from running out,Im not so technical  i want to ask a question that may sound silly. I have a E490  of which the battery is kinda weak  when i turn it off/sleep it will run out in 30-40 hrs or so. So if i just keep plugging in the charger  will the charge stop automatically when its fully charged  so it doesnt reduce the battery life significantly than charging for a cycle only?,positive,2021-12-15
Terrible Battery on New P1 Gen 4,I recently got a P1 Gen 4 with the RTX 3070. But for some reason  the battery life has been absolutely terrible! I'm talking 1-1.5 hours on best battery life settings  lowest screen brightness  dgpu disabled doing simple web browsing.   This seems highly abnormal to me  is there some setting I should try to adjust to get a normal range of battery life?,negative,2021-12-15
P1G4 - First thoughts,P1G4 3070 1tb ssd 32gb single channel. Previously using a W530 and P15.      * First pet peeve: The low travel mouse buttons. Previous models had it right because they are more embossed/protruding and require just a little more force. Perhaps the flat design makes for a better experience for trackpad users but I strictly use the trackpoint. Clicks are less frequent actions and more important actions compared to keystrokes -- I don't like the low travel.       * Second pet peeve: battery life. I feel like I'm getting 4 hours? How is this merely a small upgrade from the W530?       * The keyboard is pretty nice. I like it but I'm a bit unsure - might need to get more used to it. It has lower travel but still for some reason requires more force to push down compared to the T15. As of now I think I prefer the T15. Funny that it's the opposite situation with the mouse buttons.      * Display is beautiful. 16:10 cannot be understated.      * Excellent performance. I use it for development and I am satisfied. Mobile emulators boot/run much faster. The beastly GPU  although sometimes throttled  lets me do some gaming here and there at high settings.      * It does get quite hot if you're pushing the machine. Fans kick in. Most of the heat was north of the keyboard (a good spot IMO). A laptop stand or portable riser will definitely help with air flow / heat dissipation.       * I often carry my laptop in one hand as I move around. This model feels as sturdy as the P15  possibly sturdier  and certainly much sturdier than the W530.      Overall I am happy but not drooling over it. Maybe it will grow on me more over time.,negative,2021-12-15

How to update Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 dock firmware,"I wanted to share something that I never found an answer for online and hopefully someone who googles this finds the help they need.  So the Thunderbolt 3 Dock when you try to upload tells me on BOTH of my T480 machines:   "" Your current VGA driver version v9749 is not compatible with the firmware update tool of the dock. ""   This is basically saying that the intel graphics drivers are incompatible with the firmware update tool (Lenovo drivers/software seems to be terrible quality and not tested well at all.)   So I tried uninstalling the graphics drivers via Device Manager and then installing an older version  from Intel (I think it was Intel driver igfx\_win10\_100.9316 but as long as it is before v96xx or whatever it says  then it should work)     One thing I tried was uninstalling the Intel graphics drivers from Device manager and trying it  but then I only get a failure and it saying that it gives up updating!  &amp;#x200B;  [Update DP failed](https://preview.redd.it/tgxosfuemn081.jpg?width=2784&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fa1db93084465e19e2c5462a7199159cdfe2387f)  So then I find out that instead of uninstalling the drivers that windows update installs  you should just install the older intel drivers download to replace the win10 update automatically installed ones  otherwise it says its incompatible with your version of windows and wont let you install until windows update takes over. ( Note. must disconnect from internet to prevent windows from updating your drivers automatically.)  So finally  I disconnect from internet  replace the new drivers with the old ones downloaded from intel and then run the TB3 gen2 Dock FW update tool (trdockfw3180.exe)  and voila! DP Firmware version actually gets read correctly and flashed! It says version 0.0.0 and now it says it works. Apparently I'm one of the few to figure this out  because looking online for this answer turned up nothing and I had to try a bunch of different things to get it working. Only result is some people on the lenovo forum who were calling their ""premium support"" consisting of an engineer who in the end just giving them a new dock instead of figuring out what the issue is.      [It reads version and updates!](https://preview.redd.it/gwx43o3sln081.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8ad9d3dbef56331b1d4c05c9847dd3f1213466e6)  I'm not a windows user  so I found this extremely annoying and cumbersome. There is no linux update tool for the dock which is pretty pathetic. I think these days  Lenovo bad. Don't seem to be making quality software or hardware but that is another discussion entirely and will probably get me downvoted. 0:)  Seems like these days  Lenovo is more concerned with profits than testing their software and making solid products. This Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 Dock is already about to be EOL and receive no further updates. A $400 product and I feel this is a bit ridiculous..  Not sure how many people will run into this issue but in the future I hope this will help someone out. If it does  feel free to DM me and let me know because I am very interested and willing to help if anyone runs into this issue themselves.

Bios Update Brick Fix,Today I just turned on my recently aquired second hand T460s and it automatically installed a Lenovo Bios Update  then it got bricked with a black-lit screen and 5 beeps if I tried to press the power button.  Before this happened I installed Ubuntu on it.  I did some digging and it seems to be a problem withthw tpm chip that has been happening with older models than this one  maybe progamed obsolesensce  idk.  But well the point of this is that I managed to fix this issue by pressing the restar button with a pin  then going into the bios pressing enter inmediatly at the startup and inactivating the TPM chip.

Investing in repairing and upgrading an x230i in a not so good state? Or buy another thinkpad.,Hello!  I have this x230i that I had bought 2 years ago for very cheap from a local seller. However  he did not tell me the laptop had certain problems: broken plastic in the chassis that has been glued back  scratches on the screen and lid  proeminent green pressure spots on the display (at least it is IPS)  bluetooth module non-existant  non genuine battery.  I did not complain  however  because the laptop worked and I paid a good price.  I've been using this laptop for the last 2 years  and the i3 processor handles easily my workflow(word documents and browsing). However  the battery has degraded a lot  expecially with it being non genuine. It is a 6 cell and it lasts me ~2ish hours until it shuts down at 15%  health is at 77%. I would like to buy a 3rd party battery 9 cell for it from Green Cell.   I'm debating  though  if I should spend more money on this device  considering a new battery costs more than the device itself  and same for a new display... It's really not in a good state  and I'm not willing to repair it completely because it has too many issues.  Would you spend money on a broken thing just to remain partially broken? Is it stupid to invest in this laptop that has too many issues that I'm not willing to fix? Or should I look around for a new *used* thinkpad?  Thank you.,neutral,2021-12-16

X1C9 - Shipped after 6 days. Price Matched.,    I made a purchase from the Lenovo Pro Business account representative by phone last time.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qsbtjs/lenovo\_business\_quote\_price\_check/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/qsbtjs/lenovo_business_quote_price_check/)  X1C9; i7-1185G7  32GB RAM  256GB SSD  UHD+  Linux along with 1yr ADP as $1545 on Nov. 12.  (ships in 4+ months)  On Nov. 18  I got an email from Lenovo my order was shipped.   Checked on the UPS website  it actually has been shipped out from   LCFC(HEFEI)ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY CO LTD @ Hefei (CN)  China (what? in 6 days?)  In the meantime  I just tried to make another quote through the Lenovo Pro Business account with the same set-ups  then found a better-priced quote as $1457.     https://preview.redd.it/5nzjf2pszi081.png?width=873&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcb1ab409f14900fc3957a436c7c50a29e2eb114  Contacting through the chat  requested a ‘price match’ with a new quote  received a partial refund for the price difference.  What I learned from chat   1) I can request ‘another’ price match if there will be a better deal/quote during the BF sales.  2) However  ‘price match’ is typically done only one time.  3) Customer representative ‘can’ submit another price match request anyway  but it cannot be guaranteed. (after submission  there will be a review process by the sales dept.  and it can be denied if it was already been price-matched before)  4) Nobody knows its shipping estimated time. Vary by each CTO option  vary by timing. Too many unknown factors. But  placing an order before a big sales period (i.e.  BF) would be helpful to get your product a bit faster.  So bottom line    X1C9; i7-1185G7  32GB RAM  256GB SSD  UHD+  Linux along with 1yr ADP as $1457 (for now)  I would probably submit another price match request only if I can find a better quote in BF  but honestly  I am pretty much satisfied with my purchase.  The SSD will be replaced with Samsung 980 Pro 2TB  and possibly looking for a Lenovo’s TB4 dock later.  Hope you guys have a wonderful and safe TG Holiday! :-),positive,2021-12-17

aftermarket trackpad for t430s ?,do I just need to buy a trackpad or do I need the whole top plastic of the laptop if I want to replace it?  the trackpad seems to stick at times. meaning I put my finger to move the cursor and it doesnt move. tapping the pad a few times finally gets it to move. also the buttons have some leverage issue where if you press offset from the middle it wont register a click and and a deep press is needed. its annoying as hell to use. constantly having to repress left to get it to register a click  what are my options? is there an aftermarket tackpad? not a fan of the dimpled trackpad either. can it be sanded down smooth?,neutral,2021-12-15

HELP - Cleared Secure Boot Keys In Order To Enable Secure Boot for Windows 11 - Now I Cant Enter Windows,"Hello all.   I have a X1 Carbon second gen which was all up to date on Windows 10 and running great. I accidentally reset my Secure Boot Keys and now I cant enter Windows. It takes me to an HD select screen and when I select either of them  it shows me the Lenovo boot screen then back into the selection menu. I hope someone here can help me get back into windows or at least secure my data.   I really need some assistance like ELI5 here.   Details:   I was trying to install Windows 11 by the unsupported device method and it told me Secure Boot was disabled. So I entered BIOS and into Boot to enable Secure Boot.   For some reason I also decided to hit ""Restore to Factory Keys"" and I also am not sure if hit ""Reset to Setup Mode"" I highly doubt it but I cant be sure.  This changed my ""Platform Mode"" and ""Secure Boot Mode"" settings. One of these I recall was ""Custom""   I had this machine with Windows 8 then updated it to Windows 10 through Microsoft's free update.   I am not that savvy with PC BIOS settings anymore as I used to be while in highschool.   &amp;#x200B;  Pictures are attached.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/2cz4bn96gh081.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b22e17ce1292eade18dfaca19f6612bed02e05ad  https://preview.redd.it/v2hg4n96gh081.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=845fa6b9d7cfef976f72104dffe79db283b6e9f7  https://preview.redd.it/fn3ljla6gh081.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=324e488cc8c2a3a1748743c1523abf50b0502868  https://preview.redd.it/268sd5a6gh081.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e67e3290dc979a2c900ffc50fa4e51e66105c9f0  https://preview.redd.it/kau7h6a6gh081.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b2f364ed1acb9254a7e91815b61e897d0a64cec",neutral,2021-12-15

Thinkpad recommendation,This laptop would be mainly used for coding  very very light gaming  and internet browsing.   Budget is preferred to be under 500-600 since  I already have a beast pc.   performance- mainly just something fast enough to have multiple applications running  will be used for school and coding  build quality- I value longevity and durability. I don't mind learning how to repair it or upgrade it in the long run. Would be nice if 720p movies don't look like shit  portability- I will be taking it to school in a backpack  but I don't really mind as long as its less than 5ish pounds.   power- pref if it last at least 5-6 hours of active use  plus if you can upgrade it.

Getting my first ThinkPad  need advice.,"Hi there   My 2012 MacBook Pro is slowly dying on me after 9 years of noble services.  I don't have the budget nor the Apple addiction to go the Mac route again and thought about getting a Lenovo and run it with Linux. Although I'm a newbie with linux  I'm willing to learn it.  My usage would basically be for work (project management  a bit of programming  some conference calls  live presentations etc)  and leisure (streaming NBA games via chromecast  Netflix and such).

Thoughts on Thinkpad X13 Gen 1 keyboard?,I've had an X13 AMD 4750u Gen 1 for around 4 months now that I got refurbished straight from Lenovo and I'm not feeling 100% satisfied with the keyboard. Can fellow Gen 1 X13 users chime in on how they feel about the keyboard?  I noticed that the b  g and h keys all have less travel than the other keys and I'm not sure if this is  just part of the normal design given the trackpoint location.   Also  my right shift key feels extra clunky and loud. Little things like this bother me as the rest of the keyboard feels great as one would expect with a Thinkpad.

Please help with your suggestions!,Hi i would soon be buying a new ThinkPad. It will be for casual usage purpose- browsing  reading  streaming (no gaming). So i looked up for e14 gen3 amd here in India. With specs of ryzen 5500u  8gb ram  ips fhd screen  256gb storage  it will cost me around 55000-60000 INR equivalent to 800 usd/1000 cad. So my query is : i have heard some good things about new e series but there are disagreements as well (for series being E). So my other possibility is that i can ask from someone from my family living in Canada to buy me a t series (which is very costly here in India and doesn't makes sense to spend that much for basic purpose usage) instead new or used(won't spend that much for a used one). So how much will i be spending for such a t series laptop (in normal discounted prices as well as special days-black friday etc)? And what should be my sources for looking up these deals- ebay and what else? This will be my 1st ThinkPad so i have no idea about it and i will be using it till it doesn't breaks  so expecting around 6-7 years atleast. Thanks for your inputs.,negative,2021-12-15

Thinkpad X1C9 keyboard  touchpad  and TrackPoint randomly won't work after resuming from a long sleep on Fedora + some other distros.,I bought this Thinkpad last month and settled on Fedora 34 as my distro of choice cause everything mostly worked out of the box.  But suddenly for the last two days  I'm having this weird issue where the keyboard  touchpad  and TrackPoint just stop functioning for a while or indefinitely when resuming from suspend on Fedora. Sometimes they just start working in a couple of seconds (~ 20s)  while other times I have to hard reset the laptop  and even then sometimes they don't resume functioning. The displays work fine and I can ssh into the system without any problem so I'm sure it's not crashing. Also  I'm able to move my USB mouse when it's connected and don't have any issues with that.   Things I've tried which haven't worked -   - Disabling sleep when the lid is closed and manually putting it to sleep - Booting with an older kernel with the grub menu  - Logging in with Xorg instead of Wayland - Disabling NFC in the BIOS - Changing to Linux S3 sleep state - Upgrading to Fedora 35 (can't go back to F34 now cause apparently upgrading to F35 corrupts all my timeshift restore points.) - Live booting to other environments (Pop OS and F34) and putting the ThinkPad to sleep and waking it up. Here the problem still persisted where nothing would work for a couple of seconds but usually  it starts working after a couple of seconds  which leads me to think it might not be just a Fedora issue.  Things I noticed that were weird -  - If I resume quickly from sleep by tapping the keyboard  the ThinkPad resumes normally for the most part  except when sometimes the wifi drivers won't load and I have to put it to sleep and wake it up again.  - This one time I also noticed that when my keyboard backlight was powered on the backlight was kinda cycling from on to off randomly and when it was off I couldn't use the keyboard  touchpoint  and Trackpad but when it was on I could use them.  - If the ThinkPad is put to sleep for a long time (~ 1-2 min)  I am unable to wake it up by pressing buttons on the keyboard and the only way to wake it up is to press the power button  at which point the keyboard touchpad and Trackpoint won't work.  - I also have to mention that pretty much any other time the system is stable and I'm not having any of these issues.

"How ""good"" are the current deals? Are base prices before discount inflated?",I have been browsing for a laptop after being stuck on desktop only for a few years now and would really like to get another ThinkPad.  My old trusty X230 Tablet served me well for several years but the keyboard and battery are totally shot (also I no longer need the tablet feature and would like more than 8gb RAM).  I have been looking at Lenovo's site and seeing these seemingly amazing \~50% off deals on some models I would find acceptable  but I am wondering if anyone who follows these prices more closely could clue me in on how good of a deal these really are in general.  Also  will the deals get even better as we move into the holidays  or is this pretty much as good as it's going to get?  Also  I wasn't able to determine whether these models (mostly looking at T15) typically have expandable storage  as most seem to only say 512gb ssd. Ideally I'd be able to install another ssd for extra storage and to boot linux from as well.  Thanks in advance for any advice fellow thinkpad fans!,positive,2021-12-15
i7 or Ryzen 7 for X13 Yoga gen 2/X13 gen 2?,"My question is in two parts  CPU and model choices.  My options are the X13 yoga gen 2 and X13 gen 2 with touchscreen.    According to this  https://nanoreview.net/en/laptop-compare/lenovo-thinkpad-x13-yoga-gen-2-vs-lenovo-thinkpad-x13-gen-2-amd?m=c.3_d.1_r.2-and-c.4_d.2_r.2  The AMD looks to be a better choice but it says little about battery life where all-day usage is important to me.  The i7 has integrated 52.8Wh battery while the AMD has just 41Wh.   I can't find any reviews on the AMD except on Ryzen 5 models  according to reviewers the battery life is not as good as Intel and runs a bit hotter.  Yet in almost every review  the AMD is a more popular choice.  For my needs  I don't game much but do some 3D  video and presentation work and I travel a lot.  The X13 yoga gen 2 with i7 seems to be a better choice for the traveler because of its reinforced touchscreen and supposedly better battery life  the X13 gen 2 with AMD seems to be better for those who want more performance.  If I chose the AMD version I would also get the touchscreen  though I'm not sure on how durable that touchscreen is compared to the Yoga.    I feel that the X13 yoga i7 would be a ""safe"" choice because of the bigger battery capacity  but the X13 AMD offers superior performance which seems better for the long term.

Another t490 throttling thread.,Hello. I've owned my trusty t490 i7 MX250 since release. I have become quite accustomed to using third party programs to keep the machine from throttling.

T14 Gen 1 ran out of battery  showed CRC security error  and now won’t show the BIOS or boot into an OS,I was using my T14 Gen 1 AMD running Void Linux on 5.14.16 Xanmod Cacule kernel on S0ix. Slept the laptop  was charging some phones  and the laptop went flat (I charged like 3 or 4 full iPhone X charges with a 65% charge on the T14).  I got home  plugged it into my Lenovo USB-C Slim charger  powered it on knowing that it went flat after I drained the battery  and was greeted with a slower than usual BIOS  a loud beep (was startled because I disabled boot beeps)  and a quick flash of the text with error “CRC security issue”  searching online got me the full error “0183: Bad CRC of Security Settings in EFI variable”.

ThinkPad L15 Gen 2. 2 months later,You can check out my original review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/pzwida/thinkpad_l15_gen_2_review/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)  Everything is great from a hardware standpoint  a few issues that I ran into once is that the USB port stopped working (disabling the internal battery solved the issue). Another issues that sometimes occurs is some scraping / knocking noise from the fan but nowadays it doesn't happen anymore maybe because I don't move it around much. Trackpad sometimes can be unresponsive but I suspect its just because I have dry finger or whatever. Have issues with sleep sometimes where it drains the battery and run very warm but that is mostly fixed now.  &amp;#x200B;  One thing that bugged me a lot is the power management  I'm on Ryzen 7 5850U btw. Before I get into it yes I understand that thinkpads arent for gaming but since lockdown is still happening here I mostly do gaming on it. Here's the issue  my thinkpad can hit 25w TDP or even higher as observed in HWMonitor  but a lot of times when I game on it it is limited to 11w max which MASSIVELY impact performance. Since I only have an I-GPU every last bit of power is necessary. Thermal isn't an issue (I can leave it an entire day doing nothing and jump into gaming to observe the same issue) its just that it limits it to 11w a lot. A quick power drain (disabling internal battery) solves the issue temporary  but it comes back eventually and its annoying. I paid extra to get the Zen 3 processor and to say that I'm disappointed is an understatement when my brother's shitty huawei laptop with terrible thermals on Zen+ can run a constant 15w and maintain a fps the same and sometimes even better than mine.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm currently on Windows 11 but this problem started ever since Windows 10  my brother's huawei is also on Windows 11 and we tested both on latest updates (as of 18-11-2021).  &amp;#x200B;  I really enjoy this laptop  I really do  but this bugged me a lot and I really hope that Lenovo can look into it. If you are just a casual user I would still recommend this but if you need the performance of it  I wouldn't recommend it much.,negative,2021-12-16

Pre-Desktop Fingerprint Authentication on X220?,I've been using an X220 for my personal non-work computer for a couple years now  but have never actually used the fingerprint sensor.  I just tried to set it up for pre-desktop auth  but couldn't figure out how.  I've got a BIOS password  a hard drive password  and a setup password. I've enabled the fingerprint reader in the BIOS hardware settings  as well as enabling it w/ high security mode &amp; turning on pre-desktop authentication in the security settings. I've reset the fingerprint data via the BIOS. It never asks me to scan my fingerprint (to set up  or to boot).  How is this supposed to work?,negative,2021-12-17
Thinkpad T15 Gen2: Use external monitor with 1440p@144Hz,Hello everyone   I got quite an expensive laptop as my work computer and I am trying to connect it to my 1440p 144Hz monitor for home office. Unfortunately I only get a maximum of 75Hz at 1440p.  I looked up the device manual and it definitely has an HDMI 2.0 output. My cable and monitor port both support 144Hz since I plugged it right into my desktop computer and it works fine.  Windows settings don't show any more refresh rates other than 60/75Hz. Lower resolutions like 800x600 have 120Hz selectable so there can't be a hard limit of refresh rate either. I also tried the latest Lenovo video drivers (from October 2021) as well as the latest NVIDIA drivers.  Does this 2000€ device really not support higher refresh rates than 75Hz at 1440p?,positive,2021-12-15
Decreased Idle Temp BUT Increased Load Temp (After Repaste),I got a second hand T480s about 6 weeks ago  the fan has always been a little noisy under load  I thought i would open it up and clear the fan out  had to remove the whole fan/heat pipe unit  cleaned the fans out and re-paste the CPU (something vie done many times on laptops and desktops) with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut  Now my idle temps are down from about 34ish to about 30ish but now while watching YouTube its gone from about 45 to 55.  I've just taken it apart again to check the application of paste was ok and it seems to of been. Wish i hadn't touched it now as the fan is no quieter when it does come on  all i've done is ruin temps. Any ideas? Suggestion?  Many thanks,negative,2021-12-17

Need help with choosing first thinkpad,"    Hi  can u guys help me choose my first Thinkpad?   I’m a clinical psychologist (neuropsychologist in training) and want to buy my first Thinkpad. Since 2011  I’ve had  three macbook pro’s  but they all had expensive screen issues. I’m looking for something durable that will last for more than 3 years (unlike my macbooks). Thinkpad got that checked I suppose. I’m also curious about the keyboard! As a psychologist I need to type quite a lot.   You could say I’m more focused on build quality and batterylife because I need to take my laptop with me everywhere. The battery needs to last easily 6 hours of taking notes on Word without charger.   Performance wise I’ll use it as a daily driver so more I’ll use it more for: light gaming (Totalwar etc)  social media  browsing  Netflix  taking notes  Word  Excel  some SPSS …  As you can read  not to heavy stuff at the moment. Maybe in the future it needs to work with a bit more data (Mri  PET … images).   Screen: I’m thinking about a 2-1 or multitouch since it has some advantages for my work but don’t know if I would use it a lot. (Could I write on it like a piece of paper? Like during a session?) Also having doubts about 400 vs 500 nits. I’m worried about the battery life…  Price: I have 20% of on thinkpad products due to my employer or I can also use the student benefits. Max budget is 2000 euro. I prefer something future proof so willing to pay some more.   Thanks for the advice!

Help - Screen Blanking  Can't Take it Anymore, I need to ask the hive mind here. I've had an issue for months now  on multiple Thinkpads. My screen turns blank for 1-3 seconds  randomly  drops connection to my monitor sometimes  and then comes back. This happened on my T440  then my T470  and now it's happening on my new T490. Researching online  I get the typical advice to update display driver and check physical connections (all current and checked). I've even gone as far as to only use a bluetooth mouse and have nothing pulling power from my usb ports. VGA  HDMI  Usb-c all have the issue  and it even happens sometimes when I have no external monitor connected. It's happened at home  on a plane  doesn't matter the power or internet source. There doesn't seem to be any specific action that triggers it. I have reached the end of my rope on this one and am praying some of you have had this issue and have a fix or an idea what's happening.  Thank you in advance.,neutral,2021-12-16
Questions about replacing second  encrypted SSD in X1E,I currently have a 1TB second SSD in my X1E (gen1) and plan to replace it with a 2TB SSD (both Samsung drives). It's not my OS drive and only has data/documents  so that makes life a bit easier  but it is encrypted so I'm curious if there's anything I need to know in terms of decrypting/encrypting the old/new drive before/after cloning.   My plan would be to disable encryption on the old drive in the BIOS before removing it  installing the new drive  re-enabling encryption in BIOS  then using an external enclosure to clone the old to the new drive. Do I actually need to disable encryption on the old drive to use it in an external enclosure? And is there an easier way to go about this? Any suggestions appreciated!,neutral,2021-12-16

Some issues on Thinkpad X1 Extreme Gen 4,So  I'm still on the honeymoon with my new X1EG4 20Y5000UUS (RTX 3060 and 4K Display). I'm still deciding if I'm going to return this thing or not. I'm running Fedora Workstation 35 on it and here are the issues I have so far  just posting here to hear other people opinions (if there are any):  1. Linux S3 sleep mode (configured on BIOS) seems to work but  on resume  the track-pad does not work and I need to restart the laptop in order to get the track-pad back (the nipple and the track-pad buttons do work). With default BIOS setting it drains a lot of battery when closing the lid  I don't think it really suspends. This is kind of a deal braker  I expect my laptop to go into deep sleep when I close the lid and it is on battery so that  when I resume work it still have some juice on it (more importantly  it won't get on fire if I close the lid and throw it in my bag).  2. When docked and having an external monitor I can't close the lid on the laptop and continue working on the external monitor  it does not suspend or anything  but everything becomes very sluggish.  3. Fan noise and runs hot  even when doing normal things like attending a google meeting  watching a video  etc.  4. No Wayland with Nvidia. The latest Nvidia driver says it supports Wayland but I haven't have any luck with it. With the latest driver my laptop is on hybrid mode  using iGPU most of the time  not sure yet if I should set the Nvidia GPU as the primary one and how that would impact battery live.  I was able to solve #2 by disabling iGPU (the Intel internal GPU)  that's super weird because NVIDIA is always the issue  notebook check also recommend it:  [Notebookcheck also recommend this approach](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Lenovo-ThinkPad-X1-Extreme-Gen-4-laptop-review-Performance-flagship-with-16-10-touchscreen.578922.0.html).  I have yet to fully test #4 now that I'm running on NVIDIA only  I hope it is solved since the latest NVIDIA driver states that it supports Wayland.  What are your experience so far?,positive,2021-12-16
I'm sold! A ThinkPad is for me. However I seem to be a conundrum of which is right for me. The older ThinkPads seem to be upgradable  which is a top priority  but I also need one that's a workhorse and good for gaming. I'm assuming all ThinkPads are durable. These are the 3 priorities.,I very much doubt the newer is better with these priorities  but if that's the case then awesome. Cost  size  weight  thinness  etc. all take a back seat. However  if there's one than gives a better bang for the buck  then that's even better.   If walking me through this is tedious  then can you tell me how to tell if something is upgradable without needing to watch a million videos of each model?   Thank you,negative,2021-12-16

P14s G2 Issues and observations,Hi everyone  after using my P14s for about two months id like to say a couple of things:  1. The fan acts weirdly during suspension.

Build quality could be better: the device flexes noticeabily with little force  for example when opening/closing it. I wasn't expecting IBM-grade toughness  but for a starting price of \~1200€ it's a bit too similar to my grandma's 2013 500€ HP. A friend's X240 feels much more solid. 3. Probably just a case/coincidence: after plugging a device via Usb-C (phone and graphing tablet) on one occasion the screen wouldn't turn on during boot and on a second occasion the device remained stuck in standby.  However  the overall impression is still excellent: the keyboard is a joy  performance with the 5850u is very good and with the FHD Low power the battery life is amazing. On top of that the fan is unnoticeable 90% of the time and when under load is not that loud.,positive,2021-12-15

Extensive USB sound issues with the lastest X1 Gen9 model,Hello fellow Thinkpadders   We recently purchased a handful of Thinkpad X1 Gen 9's and we noticed there is an issue with the USB ports. When there is a sound device connected to the USB ports  applications like Teams / Skype won't work properly in a call. (With the 3.5mm sound input all is good)  The apps becomes very laggy and even tho people let you inside the meeting you are not being connected and you can't change the sound settings etc.  I have tried changing the devices I connect to the USB  running updates and updating drivers but none of these are a permanent fix. I haven't found anything yet on the internet about this issue since the computer is very new  but I've heard that other firms that have the same model have experienced the same.  I would like to find a solution / root cause to this before I distribute more computers to our employees.  Thank you for any suggestions or how to proceed!,negative,2021-12-15
ThinkPad L13 charging + KVM issue,Hi all    I'm trying to set up a ThinkPad L13 to work with my KVM-enabled monitor. Currently I am using the second USB-C port to connect the laptop to the monitor. This is working fine  I can get a picture/device control using the KVM switch in the monitor.   The issue I'm having is that the laptop isn't charging despite the power brick being plugged into the 'charging' USB-C port. If I remove the USB-C cable I'm using for KVM  or just use the KVM switch to swap to my other PC  charging kicks in. Is this normal behaviour? While the monitor does provide power through the USB-C cable its only 15w so I don't think its enough to charge the ThinkPad.  Any suggestions would be appreciated - I've googled this to death and can't find an answer!,neutral,2021-12-17

Is this overkill for what I want to do? - Just for context I work in residential architecture so nothing to crazy with the modeling.  And is the price reasonable?   I am also concerned about the shipping times even though the website says 1-3 days to ship?  Any architects/engineers here using the P1 for 3d modelling?  Any advice would be appreciated.

Is my touchpad dying? (X1 gen 9),"Originally had the problem of a SLOW trackpad  but narrowed it down to a bad charging cable when not using the stock charger. Swapped in a newer cable and that specific problem went away. I realized I was using the USB-C cable that came with an old phone with that charging block :(  Here was the post: https://v.redd.it/ic8k3ll7svy71  After fixing that I ran windows for a few days to see if any other issues came up as this is a new laptop. Everything seemed ok.  Now I wiped out my windows install and installed PopOS (my most stable distro) to see if I ran into any problems there. Everything seemed OK for the most part (except for Dota 2 NOT working under vulkan  but switching to OpenGL fixed it).  I then realized that when coming out of sleep (or lid close)  my touchpad again gets all messed up. This is different than last time. The cursor still moves slow  but now also jumps as if its missing input. A restart fixes the issue.  Im guessing slight voltage differences in the two scenarios is causing the trackpad to break. The ""bad"" cable was still able to charge the laptop  but it was enough to throw the touchpad off. When coming out of a low power state it also throws the voltage of the touchpad off which results in the slow jumpiness.  Does this sound like a bad or dying touchpad? How does Lenovo handle this sort of warranty issue? Could it possibly be a bad motherboard???  Any info would help!",neutral,2021-12-16
Had a couple of questions about the T14 and adjacent models. . .,". . . specifically the T14s and P14s -- AMD in both cases; I already have an Intel machine that can do Thunderbolt should I need it and the purpose for this one would be to replace my nice-but-aging-and-poor-at-Linux-support Yoga C940 (i7-1065G7  16GB RAM  1TB SSD 4K) as my going-places machine for workloads that don't need an i9 and dedicated graphics.  I guess a couple notes on OS  workload  and other stuff first? I slapped Linux on my C940 when it started chugging a bunch with Win11 -- the idea being that if I was probably just gonna reinstall Windows to freshen it up  I might as well detour via Linux and try a few distros -- and realized that A) I like it a lot  and B) Linux support is pretty atrocious for a bunch of the C940's parts (touchscreen  the 2-in-1 business  stylus  hi-dpi small displays) and the C940 as a device in particular (i.e. thermal management is so busted that it will run itself to a thermal shutdown unless `thermald` is set up to thermal throttle it  among other issues).  I'm super interested in these particular models (T14/P14s  and T14s) because they seem like a really nice balance of great on-the-go CPU power vs. current Intel offerings  which would be pretty conducive to what I've been up to just messing around in Linux and getting familiar with the workflow (and potentially starting to write some of my own stuff for it). The T14/P14s/T14s seem like a pretty good fit for me size- and power-wise  and they're all reasonably priced  if not crazy good deals. The spec I'm looking at in particular is:  * Ryzen 7 * 32GB RAM * 1TB+ SSD * *maybe* WWAN if it's not gonna be a crazy battery hog * the 400nit low-power IPS * Fingerprint/IR/backlight * Some variation of Arch (either Manjaro or something slightly more esoteric and a bit more trimmed down) as the OS  either Gnome or KDE as the DE  ideally on Wayland for better input support -- Wayland's also just generally been less troublesome than X11  other than KDE's atrocious hi-dpi scaling.  Now obviously if you toss all of these specs -- particularly storage -- into a build through Lenovo's site  it ends up being hideously expensive  but I can toss in parts -- RAM and storage on the T14/P14s  just storage (which is by far the worst part) on the T14s -- when I actually get them in. Question time:  * I guess first things first  Linux support? Arch Wiki doesn't seem to have entries for the T14s Gen 2; while the T14/P14s look pretty good  the Gen 1 T14s seems less than stellar. Don't get me wrong  any of these will be an improvement over the C940  I'd just rather A) avoid problems before needing to fix them  and B) see what folks actually running Linux have to say. * Is the T14s' bigger battery actually worth the price delta *for the whole thing*  i.e. not for the ticket price getting it from Lenovo (where the T14s is some $400 more because it includes all the RAM) but after adding a big drive and RAM (closer to a couple hundred  plus I'm getting a 256GB drive as as case candy vs. 128GB  essentially  because I'd never really use it)? The weight savings and somewhat more rigid build are nice-to-haves  but if I'm actually getting another  say  hour of battery  that's a huge point in favor * Is there actually any difference between the T14 and P14s other than very inconsistent part pricing? They both still end up pretty much the same price after all the upgrades  pretty much every resource/poster says ""yes"" but it just seems . . . kinda dumb? to sell the same computer twice over when the difference is the (swappable) graphics drivers. * Any chance I can fit a bigger battery in the T14 if I don't need a smart card? Happy to toss some double-sided tape at it if I have to  I just have this gut feeling that 50Wh is gonna be *so close* to excellent for my needs  but not quite. * Glass trackpad swap is a given on the T14  but (please don't shoot me) any way to get rid of the trackpoint buttons and get the touchpad real estate back? I remember seeing one that had (IIRC) capacitive ""buttons"" that everyone hated -- I know it's somewhat unorthodox seeing the subreddit I'm posting in  but I'm super used to touchpads and my workflow/virtual desktops/gestures/everything is best-suited to that as the primary pointing device.  * Is 32GB of RAM nutty crazy overkill? I'm thinking just reserve 8GB of it for graphics (especially compelling with the T14s' faster memory) and use the 24GB left to appease my monstrous-and-growing collection of browser tabs. * Speaking of the T14s' memory  is it single-  dual-  or quad-channel? Lenovo doesn't really specify  and normally I would just assume dual-channel  but one review had a casual aside mentioning that it ran quad-channel. No big deal if it doesn't  just curious  but that would be another pretty good nice-to-have on it. * WWAN -- is it worth it? I have a Pixel 4 currently  and have always preferred smaller phones  so I don't generally do too well with battery life while tethering. I'm on Fi  and literally have a data sim sitting in an old phone is a desk drawer  so I'd be super interested in getting a WWAN card. I hate having to poke through websites and stuff on my phone  which is pretty much used for (gasp) phone stuff  music  and occasionally the news  so being able to just like  plonk my laptop down wherever I feel like it and go do stuff seems like a massive win for me. *Unless* it's a battery hog -- if it's gonna let me browse wherever but only for half as long  that's not great. An hour less on WWAN vs. wifi or wired is acceptable  2 isn't ideal  but any more than that is a dealbreaker. I dunno how good the cards on Thinkpads are  but if it's quick enough to enable WWAN and get a signal I'm happy to just keep it off when I don't need it  but if it needs more than 2 minutes to connect then that's more annoying than anything. * If you've actually read this far before replying (bless you  brave soul)  what's your favorite third of Neapolitan ice cream?  TL;DR: Lenovo lineup big  caveman brain small -- T14/P14s vs. T14s as an intro-to-breaking-shit-in-Linux machine that can double as a solid all-day portable; plus questions about options and stuff.",neutral,2021-12-15

Last Comparison: T15 Gen 2 Intel vs X1 Extreme gen 4,My final comparison to choose a laptop. Both are the sizes I want/need. Both have same boost clock on CPU  but the x1 has double the cores.

The extreme also comes with 1Tb of storage which is pretty cool. Im using them for programming  linux  and college work  little to no gaming on them.

Carbon X1 5th Gen Battery/Charging Issue,"I've recently been trying to resurrect my old Carbon X1  which had not been turning on properly for quite some time.  One obvious problem was that the original battery had a bad cell  so I replaced it. After doing that  it actually started working again  when plugged in. While plugged in  my OS says that it is indeed charging. Unfortunately though  that does not seem to be true  as the charging level does not increase over time.  Furthermore  when it is not plugged in  it will happily show the Lenovo splash screen  at which point it then sometimes flashes  ""0190: Critical low-battery error""  and consequently just turns off.  My first hunch is that there is some issue with the charging circuitry.

Multiple internal drives on new T series?,"I've been buying Thinkpads since the 90s  and I've always been a huge fan of the modular design and easy service of the T-series in particular  with the T420p (""Look mom  four drives!"") being my all time favorite.   I currently carry a T470p that is equipped with a 250GB m.2 drive and an 8TB 2.5"" SSD.

X1 Extreme 2 Overheating in idle after Windows 11 update,"So I have this weird behaviour after I updated to Windows 11 a month ago.   With Windows 10 the temps were ""as expected"" from a thin and light like the X1E-Series   When Idle my cpu temps hover around 65 to  70 degrees and the fans kick in considerably  as in I can definetly hear them going on but nevertheless the machine won't cool down in idle.    Weirdly enough when I do light gaming (like among us) the machine cools down to around 45 to 50 degrees and the fans are not even on.   I untervolted the machine with throttlestop and am running tpfan with the dualfan mod.   If I do heavy work (like Autodesk Revit) it obviously gets hot  but like so hot  that it almost burns my fingertips when I touch the chassis above the Keyboard.   When I open up Taskmanager the cpu when idle does not take more load than 5%  so I really don't know whats going on. Also the machine doesn't seem to go into the deep C-States when in Idle wich is very weird to me.     If anybody has a clue as of what is happening plz feel free to comment.

Resurrection of a dead W520  a long story (with pictures!),"A while back  no  some years back  I got a W520 that I added to my collection of tech. As a hobby  I fix things and this W520 I got was dead. No picture at all when turning it on  some beep tunes from the BIOS and that's all what I got. Previous owner had issues with flashing the BIOS  so it was either some issue with the data on the BIOS EEPROM or a bad logic board.   I had this laptop in storage for years and recently thought  why not try to finally fix it. So I started by buying one of those USB programmer boards with not so high quality test clips.  ""Great  that'll be an easy job"" I thought: Just remove the keyboard  connect the programmer using the test clip  put a fresh BIOS binary BLOB onto the EEPROM and it would work again  right? Man was I wrong.   The first issue was  that the test clip would not fit onto the EEPROM chip as it was just a bit too large to fit next to the central frame of the W520. So I removed a bit of the central frame to make the test clip fit onto the chip.   &amp;#x200B;  [Meet the target: Winbond 25Q64CV](https://preview.redd.it/2va9bdn8rpz71.jpg?width=1512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01f1f4fa03aa0899f426129a202c3d135b3fd342)  I tried and tried. And I didn't get a connection. Great. Then I put the laptop aside for a while and tried to find out  how others would solve this. Removing the chip using a hot air station was out of the question  as my solder skills are  well  not that great lol. I happend to read some posting where people were talking about those solder pads right next to the EEPROM being connected to the EEPROM. Using a multimeter I could confirm  that those solder pads were indeed connected to the chip.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  [So with making use of my not so great soldering skills  I soldered some cables to those 8 pads and was able to connect a CH341A programmer to the EEPROM without having to desolder the IC itself.

Boy  was I proud. For a moment at least  until a password prompt showed and was asking for a password that I didn't know.   So I put the laptop aside for another couple of days  did some research about how to remove a password on a laptop and found a posting somewhere that said  how it could be done. But this involved some more work: The complete disassembly of the W520.   &amp;#x200B;  [That's a lot of cables  stuff and things to be removed  duh. So I took some pictures of the original state and started the disassembly. ](https://preview.redd.it/iui68o9zspz71.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9ea2ee5420078aa3d8f46303161e5432bd04451)  &amp;#x200B;  [The guts of a W520 in all it's glory.

But as I said  I like fixing things and to further improve my repair skills  learning along the way. Still to do:   \- Fix the keyboard (missing key)  \- Remove the sticker on the touch pad and put a new sticker onto it  \- The bird sticker on the lower left side stays. That's non negotiable  The method I used for removing the password only works up to the W530 series  so on newer laptops  you're either out of luck or will have to find a different method  if one exists.

"A ""perfect"" T480 upgrade to the reasonable max journey.","I will tell You a story of how I upgraded my T480 to the possibly maximum configuration  starting from a mid-range machine  all the way to the top end.  I got my T480 in late 2019  it was brand new. Initially it was an i5-8350u/16/512 machine with a crappy 1080p touchscreen  darfon keyboard and only the fingerprint reader as a bonus. Over the last year I upgraded my machine bit by bit. Unfortunately my motherboard got damaged while i was replacing the touchpad. I wanted to test it outside of the case and left the battery plugged in. Basically the motherboard works perfectly fine as long as the trackpad is not plugged in. Since my board was partially broken and noone in my area was able to fix it completely  I started searching for another one.  I was able to sell my broken motherbord for quite a good price to a guy that made an ""desktop PC"" out of it  and bought myself an i7-8550u board with Nvidia MX150 dedicated GPU. From there  I wanted to max out my machine  and I think that I achieved my goal.  So basically here's my T480 config:  * Intel Core i7-8550u * Nvidia MX150 dGPU * 32gb of 2666MHz of GoodRam RAM (Samsung dram chips) * Samsung SSD 980 1TB NVMe * 400nit Low Power 1080p IGZO display from Innolux (N140HCG-GQ2) * Backlit Chicony USE keyboard * X1 Extreme glass touchpad * ThinkShutter screen bezel (I like it more than the IR camera) * Intel AX210 WiFi 6E * Fibocom L830-EB LTE WWAN * Smartcard reader * Fingerprint reader * NFC reader * Internal 24Wh battery (brand new original) * External 24WH and 72Wh batteries (both original) * Dualbooting Windows 11 Pro and Manjaro Gnome (might switch to KDE)  Is there something i missed? I always wanted to spec out an upgradable ThinkPad to the ""reasonable maximum""  so for example i could go with 64GB of ram but that would be overkill  and i could go with 1440p or 4k screens  but i am fine with 1080p  being low power too it saves a ton of battery life  and I'm currently fine with 1TB of storage.  As for keyboards - i tried all of them. I want backlight. I tried the Darfon  Chicony and Liteon keyboards. Darfon was very soft  i did not like the key feel and the trackpoint buttons were janky. As for Liteon - my fingers would hurt if i typed on it for longer periods of time  and the backlight was too warm for me. (As a previous T450s user i loved the Liteon keyboard on it and hated the Chicony  now it seems to be the opposite on newer models...)  I eventually settled on Chicony backlit USE keyboard  as it has the best key feel  no trackpoint jitter  no trackpoint button problem and has a nice pure white even backlighting. As a sidenote i replaced the trackpoint buttons and trackpoint nub on my Chicony keyboard with those from Liteon  as they have a lot more saturated red color on the buttons and the trackpoint cap itself.  And yeah  i have an i7-8550u instead of the i7-8650u  but that's a very minor thing  basically only missing out on vPro which i probably would never use  and the clock speeds are lower (1.8 to 4.0 GHz vs 1.9 to 4.2GHz on the vPro model. Also i think the ethernet nic is slightly worse in the non vPro model but it is a very minor difference. As a sidenote. I upgraded the thunderbolt firmware as soon as I received my replacement motherboard.  What would You suggest would be still upgradable? I already installed all the hardware addons that i could think of (nfc  smartcard fingerprint  thinkshutter)  so i suppose hardware-wise everything is maxed out?  I am not going to install the classic keyboard in it  as i am quite used to the new island keyboards  and i type faster on these than on my classic machines.     I hope this machine will last me a few good years. I really enjoy using it.",positive,2021-12-17

Thinkpad vs M1 Max MBP,"Hey all  I'm a longtime Thinkpad user but have been using Apple the last few years (again). My 2017 MBP turned out to be a lemon  and by some miracle  Apple has offered to replace it with a current model. I would have to pay extra for anything they deem an upgrade. I won't know about that until I get the bill  which is concerning. My current MBP could be worth $50 or $5000 - who knows what they'll offer me.  It's been a massive pain to get them to process this  and I'm looking at sometime next year. I use my MBP for work when traveling  so it can't fail again.

X1 Extreme Gen 4 Nvidia Question,"So  I'm still trying out this laptop (X1 Extreme Gen4 + RTX 3060). I have installed fedora on it and successfully installed the NVIDIA drivers as seen here:  ``` lspci |grep -E ""VGA|3D"" 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation TigerLake-H GT1 [UHD Graphics] (rev 01) 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA106M [GeForce RTX 3060 Mobile / Max-Q] (rev a1) ```  Looks like I'm on some kind of `hybrid` mode and it seems that everything is using just the iGPU since the only process on the output of `nvidia-smi` is `/usr/libexec/Xorg`.  My question is  is it possible to set the NVIDIA as the primary GPU? And if so  is it worth it?",neutral,2021-12-15
ThinkPad on a budget for programming?,Hey I know this question is probably asked a lot and I searched but didn't see any that matched my price range in recent history.

Thoughts on using an eGPU with T15 Gen. 2 (i7 11th gen / TB4),Hi   I am considering using an eGPU with my ThinkPad and to ditch my desktop  so I don't have to have and manage 2 PCs. This thought is very appealing to me  so I'm investing some effort into it.  I did a bit of research and it's obvious there's a penalty when comparing the performance of a GPU in a laptop (as an eGPU) and a comparable desktop PC. E.g. see here: [https://techplanet.today/post/laptop-egpu-vs-desktop-how-much-bottleneck](https://techplanet.today/post/laptop-egpu-vs-desktop-how-much-bottleneck)   However  this was done with RTX 3090 and while the desktop absolutely destroys the laptop  I am surprised to see the difference percentage lowers as the actual FPS lowers too. Could it still be a valid option?  I am thinking of buying a Razer Core X Chroma and putting my RX 580 in it for now. What do you think is reasonable for me to expect  performance wise? E.g. I am playing Mass Effect Andromeda and Legend of Grimrock 2 atm. I use a 1440p 144Hz monitor with Freesync.   On the desktop I have Windows 10  while Ubuntu is on the laptop. But I am ready to consolidate and set them up as dual boot on a single machine. All I want in Linux is for my external display and devices that are connected to the eGPU case to work. I don't need to run games in Linux.  As someone who is a casual gamer nowadays  playing mostly games that are a few years old by the time I get to them  I would be happy with 60+ FPS in my games  so I think this kind of setup is something I could be ok with? I would be upgrading to a better 1440p card later.  Also  by chance  has anyone tried the Razer Core X on the T15 Gen. 2? On top of that  on Linux? 😅,neutral,2021-12-15

Assistance picking out proper laptop,I'm looking for a new ThinkPad laptop.  I wanted to go with one of the new 5000 series AMD processors but I can't seem to find one that offers at least 2x m.2 2280 slots. I have two already  and I wish to just set them into my laptop when it arrives. One of them already has my linux install ready to go.  &amp;#x200B;  It seems if I want to go for a laptop with at least 2 M.2 2280 slots I need to get a P15 Gen 2  with Intel.  &amp;#x200B;  Is there any other options I've not found throughout my research? All the AMD options seem to only have one m.2 slot. I don't mind going Intel but would like to double-check to make sure.  &amp;#x200B;  My only requirements are pretty much 14-15inch  at least 2x m.2 2280 slots  at least 64GB of ram  works with the ThinkPad usb-c dock  and a strong processor. Dedicated GPU is a bonus  I know you don't get this going for an AMD processor though.  &amp;#x200B;  Are there any other options that offer the above?,neutral,2021-12-16

Dual monitor setup advice,I have a two laptop setup at home for a work Thinkpad (t490) and one I just ordered for myself (T14 gen 2 AMD replacing a surface pro 3 with surface dock).  My work provided me with a Thinkpad USB 3.0 dock and utilize both ports going into my monitors dsub ports. For.my old surface I used some mini display port HDMI splitter to go to the HDmi I ports on those same monitors. This allowed me to switch easily between the t490 and surface pro.  My sp3 is about dead now so looking for an alternative to easily make a similar setup. I don't know if a normal USB c to HDMI splitter will work out if people have found a better setup. Any help is appreciated.,negative,2021-12-17
ThinkPad T440p won't start,Hey y'all! My gf's T440p wont load into Windows or the BIOS. When you turn it on it gets stuck at the ThinkPad logo and stays there for a while prompting to press enter to interrupt normal setup. It takes for the thing to load into that menu like 15-20 minutes. I have tried to get into the bios by pressing f1 but it gets stuck at a black screen saying some text about intel boot management or something.  And also I've seen videos of people entering the BIOS on this kind of laptop and in the vids it beeps once and its kind of short. But when I try it on this one it is a long beep that last like 10 seconds. Anybody encountered something like this? Thank!!,neutral,2021-12-15
T420 vs T440p which should I choose?,Hi there  I'm a CS student looking for some tough laptop that can handle the day to day. I've looking for some good deals in my country (Colombia) and I found a T420 in almost 209 dls and a T440p in 250 dls. Currently I'm not working with any heavy stuff just light code for the moment but I'm looking for upgradability in the future  both of them have an hdd and 8 gb of ram. The t420's processor is an Intel core i5 2540 and the t440p's processor is an Intel core i5 4300.,negative,2021-12-15

Is it possible to extend ThinkPad warranty via a third party website from other countries?,Hi everyone  I got a T14 Gen2 AMD with a 1 year base warranty and was about to extend the warranty directly from Lenovo but the quotation price is very expensive. Still regret not buying it with the laptop though. I found that the warranty at Laptops Direct (UK) is cheaper  but don't know if they can apply the extension to foreign ThinkPads?

X1Y1 Touchscreen Sensitivity - How to adjust?,"tl;dr: Lenovo X1Y1  model 20FQ - Is there a way to lower the touchscreen sensitivity? I'm done with accidental taps while scrolling.  A students story with an old thinkpad  episode three.  I got a used X1Y1 from my dad  and find it extremely useful at university. Saves loads of space otherwise paper notebooks would take  allows to quickly add photos of presentations to my notes and manages to run basic linux vms on the go instead of bothering with nasty decade old 10$ keyboards and C2D pcs otherwise serving us. Yuck.  It is a very good device to use without a mouse. In fact  tablet/tent mode is amazing for Youtube  despite graphics unable to do 1440p60. One issue is very painful though  namely whenever I browse web  touch input seems overly sensitive - to a point where scrolling google results or youtube feed ends up with ""touching"" a result sending me to a video/website making poor old cpu choked for next 3-4 seconds.  I was looking for touchscreen sensitivity settings on my own  with no luck. I found a google result that pointed to Precision drivers' touchpad sensitivity settings - for some reason  also impacting the touchscreen(?)  however I was unable to check it because touchpad on this machne simply came without Precision support. Yes  many of you managed to install it  but I never found a version that just worked out of the box on Windows 10 and 11 and simply decided to leave it as-is. Reasoning being ofc time &gt; fun from using gestures to control music playback.  In summary  I want to simply fix the god damn sensitivity being way too high. Is there a way? Or is that an ""early adopter"" of Wacom-powered touchscreen tax that I'm dealing with? Any helpful advice or even a pointer would be great.",neutral,2021-12-16
